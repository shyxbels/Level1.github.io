SHORT BACKGROUND / DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY                           The Philippines has started to make headway in education through the policies that                 aim to expand access and improve quality. The need for human capital development has been                  the  main  motivation  behind  such  educational  reforms,  as  detailed  in  the  current                 administration’s Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017-2022. Despite notable gains, work                 remains, especially in terms of academic performance, the number of educational facilities                 and participation rates. To address these issues, the government has significantly increased                 education  expenditure  over  the  years,  initiated  structural  changes  in  basic  and  higher                  education, and intensified partnerships with the private sector and industry.                         The  education  system  consists  of  the  three  components:  basic  education,  higher                 education  and  the  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  (TVET).  The  basic                 education directed by the Department of Education (DepEd) has undergone a major change                 in which Kindergarten is mandated in the elementary curriculum and the Enhanced Basic                 Education  Act  of  2013,  also  known  as  the  K-12  law,  made  attending  secondary  school                 mandatory  and  extended  the  curriculum  by  two  years.  On  other  hand,  higher  education","directed by the Commission of Higher Education (CHED) which includes undergraduate and                 postgraduate programs.                         Technology  has  made  it  possible  for  us  to  gain  access  to  diverse  and  abundant                 information.  Students  can  harness  this,  evaluate  which  ones  are  accurate  and  have                  significance, and use it to address a certain issue. Alternative Delivery Modes (ADM) was                 implemented by DepEd to address the problem on classroom congestion and other situations                 and circumstances which prevent children from going to and staying in school.                         Virtual learning is a learning experience that is enhanced through utilizing computers                 and/or  internet  both  outside  and  inside  the  facilities  of  the  educational  organization.  The                  instructions most commonly take place in an online environment the teaching activities are                 carried out online whereby the teachers and learners are physically separated.                         According to Tech Target (2019), a virtual learning environment (VLE) could be a set                 of teaching and learning tools designed to reinforce a student's learning expertise together                 with computers and also the web within the learning method. The principal parts of a VLE                 package embrace information mapping, student following, on-line support for each teacher                 and  student,  transmission  (e-mail,  rib  discussions,  chat,  net  publishing),  and  web  links  to                  outside information resources.                         In addition, Koskela et al. (2005) found out, that the number of latest virtual learning                 environments (VLEs) is increasing and that are being publicized as an answer for remote and                 cross-border education. Students will perform a large vary of exercises with a computer-based                 learning setting. This can be extraordinarily necessary once the tasks cannot be experienced                  in reality, as an example because of their unsafe nature.                         In the Philippine, the concept of e-Learning is relatively new due to lack of infrastructure                 and high cost of internet access. Public education suffers from shortages or lack of computers                 and internet access. However, the high regard for better quality education among Filipinos can                 be manifested on various government programs and policies that promote online learning into                 curriculum development.","Methods of Research subject is one of the subjects injected in all the programs in the                 tertiary  education.  It  aims  to  develop  critical  thinking  and  problem-solving  skills  through                 qualitative and quantitative research for college students regardless of their program.                         Research and development (R \& D) is one of the necessary fields for an industry or                  company to survive. Whether a new or established company, they need to invest in R \& D, so                 what more for a country?                         Innovation is a strategy needed to have a successful R \& D, which requires innovative                 people.  According  to  Patalinhug  (2003),  Philippine  innovation  system  requires  the                 collaboration of the university and relevant industry associated with the courses provided by                  the school. He further stressed, that students who are the future workers of the state will                 appreciate the importance of innovation, do a little bit of R \& D activities.                         Those points of view, were considered by the researchers, the reason for choosing                 Methods of Research subject to pilot VITLE.                         With this, VITLE would focus on developing an alternative virtual learning program for                 college students in Methods of Research subject. Critical to achieving success in this area is                 the training of learners that includes providing appropriate instruction and continuing updates,                  considering the dynamic nature of developments in research.                         The proposed alternative learning system is a virtual learning environment that could                 level up a modern-day method of teaching-leaning delivery that saves time and space, has                 economic value, and considers convenience of the teachers and learners.","II.

It offers a new platform where instructors can further educate their students is a much                         efficient and interactive manner.                     2.  Classes in this system can easily be managed by adding, updating and even deleting.                     3.  Instructors and students in this system can easily be managed by adding, updating,                         changing password and even deleting,                     4.  `monitoring  the  classes,  instructors  and  student  using  this  system  provides                         convenience with the use of the administrator panel overview.                      5.  Interaction from the instructor to student and vice versa is made possible by the chat                         feature of the system.                     6.  Instructors can upload their PDF file learning materials as well as quizzes in the system                         for the students.                     7.  Instructors can easily manage their lessons by adding, viewing, downloading and/or                          deleting it, as for quizzes the instructors can add, view and/or even delete it.                     8.  Instructors  can  easily  register  new  students  to  her  class  in  case  a  student  is  not                         automatically registered by the administrator.                     9.  Instructors and student can freely change the password and display picture of their                         own accounts.                     10. Students can view and download the lessons uploaded by the instructor as well as                         view and answer the quizzes.                   However, the following are the limitations of the project:                     1.  Instructors can only upload PDF file format learning materials for their lessons.","2.  Only multiple choice type of quizzes can be uploaded in the system.                     Research Objective 4:                         The  objective  number  4  of  the  study  is  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  Virtual                 Interaction in Teaching and Learning Environment (V.I.T.L.E.) in Methods of Research Subject                 website.                   Data Collected: Not Completed                    IV. INSIGHTS                          We have encountered quiet a lot of challenges along the way in doing this research,                 one of such is the lack of knowledge in this particular branch of information technology which                 is web development. Not everything is taught inside the four corners of our lecture rooms or                  laboratories, we know that but learning things during this classes is not just the only thing that                 is important we know then realize that picking a certain field in your degree where you can                 utilize your skills at most is necessary when it comes to choosing a topic of your research.                          Lacking the skill set we need to conclude this research force us to seek new and                 different  sources  of  learning  focused  in  web  development  to  gain  the  knowledge  that  our                 research requires.                             Finalizing our research is a much harder due to the restrictions on the things that we                 can do freely due to the implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) as                 precaution to the COVID-19 pandemic. These restrictions dramatically decreased the rate of                 our progress in these recent months and press us to communicate online. Truly no one can                 delay  the  future  and  the  future  calls  for  the  new  normal  to  be  adapted.","Overall,  our  journey  in  concluding  this  research  is  an  irregular,  challenging  and                 unexpected but at the same time necessary and fruitful.

Rationale                  The Higher Education 4.0 trends and future perspectives for teaching and learning are equally                affected by the rapid changes we are facing today. These trends are significant to meet the                future needs and challenges in education through the pervasive application of Information and                Communication Technology (ICT).                 Discussion and dissemination of Higher Education 4.0 could enhance teachers’ capability                since 74 percent of the faculty members in the T3 Campuses are not an education graduate                and/or do not belong in any professional education organization that could aid in the                discussion.                 To date, only 13 percent of the T3 Campuses faculty members are engaged in research                activity because some do not have enough understanding and enlightenment on the research                proposal preparation. Although all permanent faculty members are involved in community                activities/services, they have limited knowledge on how to prepare a comprehensive extension                activity proposal.                  Overview                  On January 30-31, 2019, the teachers and staff of the T3 Campuses, Tanza, General Trias                City, and Trece Martires City, joined together for this semester’s Teachers’ Capability                Enhancement Seminar Workshop at International House I, Cavite State University, Indang                Cavite from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The two-day seminar workshop featured five guest                speakers who covered various topics promoting the growth and development of teachers in                the academe.                 The capability enhancement seminar was designed to promote continuous development of                teachers as they gear up for the second semester of school year 2018-2019. The guest                speakers who tackled various topics that centered on becoming effective teachers in our                country’s relatively new period of outcomes-based education and technology-driven teaching                strategy, successfully prepped the T3 faculty in their various departments for the many                challenges that lay ahead of them this semester.","Day 1                  For Day 1 of the seminar, the opening prayer was led by Tanza General Education Department                faculty, Mr. Mark Joel C. Sibulo, while the welcome remarks was given by Prof. Noel A. Sedigo,                T3 Campus Administrator. Vice President for Academic Affairs Dr. Camilo A. Polinga, thru Ms.                Agnes Nuestro, gave his inspirational message to all seminar participants. Afterwards, Prof.                Vienna Mi A. Feranil, T3 Curriculum Development and Instruction Head gave her talk on                leveling the expectations and objectives of the T3 faculty in order to properly align themselves                to the goals of the university, the campus, as well as their respective departments.

Rationale                  The Higher Education 4.0 trends and future perspectives for teaching and learning are equally                affected by the rapid changes we are facing today. These trends are significant to meet the                future needs and challenges in education through the pervasive application of Information and                Communication Technology (ICT).                 Discussion and dissemination of Higher Education 4.0 could enhance teachers’ capability                since 74 percent of the faculty members in the T3 Campuses are not an education graduate                and/or do not belong in any professional education organization that could aid in the                discussion.                 To date, only 13 percent of the T3 Campuses faculty members are engaged in research                activity because some do not have enough understanding and enlightenment on the research                proposal preparation. Although all permanent faculty members are involved in community                activities/services, they have limited knowledge on how to prepare a comprehensive extension                activity proposal.

Objectives                        The activity aimed to provide a clearer understanding on how the flexible learning  will                be conducted in the T3 Campuses for the First Semester, AY 2020-2021 and at the same time                come up with a united desire on how to provide quality education to students despite the                pandemic.

Answer (Ms. Feranil): Books are not required, but there are books which are already reviewed,                evaluated, and approved by the University Textbook Board especially in General Education                subjects that may be used as references.                 Question (BSP 1-Trece): Do we need to pay any fees?

Question (Tanza Student): Who will decide on the type of platform to use in learning, whether                CvSU eLearning o Google classroom, is it the student?

Question (First Year-Trece): What will happen to those students who are qualified for                admission but did not able to submit original admission requirements?

Answer (Ms. Busog): Yes, but we are still waiting for the account from Main Campus.                 Question (BSP 1-Trece): How would be the distribution of modules and submission of activities                for those who prefer modular mode of learning?                Answer (Ms. Feranil): There are assigned day for each program, for the pickup of learning                materials and submission of activities in the campus as stated in the virtual class  schedule                provided.                 Question (BSBM-Trece): What will happen if we are taking online quiz, and there were                technical interruptions, is the system capable of saving the status of our quiz?                Answer (Ms. Banag): Yes, it may be saved. The Instructor will just set the time for the quiz.                 Question (BSIT Parent): Will the University provide the students with a copy of University                Academic Calendar and the tutorial on how to use the system and take the examinations?                Answer (Mr. Villavicencio): Yes, calendar will be provided to students through Facebook page                the same with the tutorial which was presented earlier. Since this orientation is in FB Live,                students may review or replay the tutorial anytime since this will not be deleted anymore. And                at the same time, during the first week of class orientation, Instructors will discuss again the                process of using the learning platform.                 Question (BSHRM-Trece): When will we have our OJT which are scheduled last Midterm?                Answer (Ms. Sidamon): OJTs are allowed if it is online.                  Question (GenTri Student): I am a working student; can I still attend to online classes?                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Yes, you may. Because we discourage synchronous classes.                 Question (Trece Student): Are the learning materials downloadable?                Answer (Mr. Ty): Yes, all learning materials once uploaded to the platform are ready for                download anytime as long as you have your device.                 Question (First Year Student): Are we required to attend online class in uniform? Do we need                to buy one?                Answer (Ms. Feranil): No, just wear appropriate outfit that is appealing to the class.                 Question (Gen. Trias Student): How sure that the answers to online exams taken by students                are authentic, since they could search the net while taking the exam?                Answer (Mr. Villavicencio): College set up is different from high school or senior high school.                Examinations are skill based and not knowledge based only. Questions can be reshuffled,                have timer and other strategies, your instructors may set it.                  Question: Which is the best mode of learning?                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Modular mode of learning are very risky for everyone. Since, there are                limited transportation and at the same time there is increasing number of COVID cases in the                area. But if you really prefer the modular type, modules will be available in a designated area                in the campus entrance where you can get your modules. But if you want it to be delivered to                your doorsteps, yes, it is possible, but you will shoulder the cost of shipping. But we cannot                give you the whole semester module because that is so many pages. That is why we                discourage the modular type of learning. Unlike online, materials will be uploaded to the LMS                or Google classroom or could be send to you through fb messenger, chat groups, email or                even text messages. Synchronous classes are discouraged, so meaning, if you will have the                online, it is not necessary that you spend load for the data daily for zoom classes, no. We will                have the asynchronous type of teaching and learning. Because our motto is NO ONE                SHOULD BE LEFT BEHIND.                Online is more advantageous, cheaper, or safer rather than modular.                Another thing, we should also invest on this. Especially IT students, not only connectivity but                also having a laptop is necessary in your program.","Question (BSE Student): Do we have the qualifying examination schedule? If ever, will it be                online?                Answer (Mr. Ty): There are previous announcements that it will be scheduled in latter part.                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): The qualifying exam is still face to face and is probably scheduled in                January 2021.                 Question: Do we need to pay for the printing of modules?                Answer (Mr. Ty): No payment. It is free for students because CHED paid for their tuition and                school fees.                 Question (Gen. Trias Student): How about the academic scholars?                Answer (Ms. Sidamon): Only Tulong Dulong and TES are active scholarship grant for this                semester.                 Question (BSE Student): If we have 3-hour virtual class schedule, do we need to attend 3                hours virtual class also?                Answer (Ms. Feranil): No, we prepared the virtual class schedule for you to be aware of the                available schedule for the teacher for consultation and possible queries or clarifications on the                lesson. This flexible learning is a self-paced learning, so you can do the readings or studying                in your convenient time not necessarily during the virtual class schedule. In addition,                attendance is not part of the grading system for this semester.                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): In addition, during virtual class schedule, that is the time that the                teacher will post the lessons and made himself available to students’ consultations.                 Question (Parent): I am an OFW parent, can I monitor my child’s performance in the online                learning platform?                Answer (Ms. Busog): Yes, if the student will allow their parents to access his/her account,                he/she will give the username and password of the student.                 Question (New Student): How can we meet our teachers? Are we going to look or contact                them, or they are the one who will contact us?                Answer (Ms. Feranil): Each section has assigned Registration Adviser. They are the one                tasked to look for the students and create a group for the class. Then later, all subject teachers                will be added to the group, so that there will be only one group for each class to elicit confusion                on the part of the student on how to communicate and whom.                 Question (Irregular Student): How about if virtual class schedule is conflict with my back                subjects, do I need to drop the subject?                Answer (Ms. Anonas): No, flexible learning is self-paced and can do the learning even not                during the virtual class schedule.                 Question: How will the lesson be delivered? Is the lesson/module will be provided for the whole                semester one at a time?                Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Preparing a module is not the easy but almost all faculty have their                modules for one month or until Midterm except for some that they really have prepared the                whole module for one semester. So module delivery, is by lesson or chapter, so that you will                not be overwhelmed by the lessons and the activities.","Program of Activities","Evaluation Results                              CRITERIA                   PARENTS           STUDENTS           OVERALL                  Meeting your expectation                 4.62               4.18              4.19                  Attainment of the objectives             4.54               4.32              4.33                  Topics discussed                         4.69               4.47              4.47                  Input presentation                       4.69               4.17              4.18                  Management team / Secretariat            4.62               4.29              4.30                  Virtual arrangement                      4.38               4.15              4.16                  Over-all assessment                      4.69               4.38              4.39                           Overall Rating                  4.60               4.28              4.29                 Comments:                1.
