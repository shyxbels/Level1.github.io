Filipinos want to spend time with family, friends, and their community.              They want to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle, including having a decent house with             secure long-term tenure, convenient transport, and being able to travel for vacation.              They want to feel secure about the future, wherever they are and wherever they want             to go. They want to live long and healthy and are looking forward to enjoying their             retirement.              Such is the AmBisyon Natin 2040 – it is our collective ambition. At the same time,             we want it to be the Vision for the country, for which government will formulate             policies and implement programs and projects to enable all Filipinos to attain this             AmBisyon.              On October 11, 2016, President Rodrigo R. Duterte signed Executive Order No. 5, s.             2016 approving and adopting the 25-year long-term vision entitled AmBisyon Natin             2040 as a guide for development planning (Refer to Annex 1 for the EO). It also laid             down four areas for strategic policies, programs, and projects over the next 25 years             that will help realize the AmBisyon Natin 2040. These areas are:                 a)   Building a prosperous, predominantly middle-class society where no one                    is poor;                b)   Promoting a long and healthy life;                c)   Becoming smarter and more innovative; and                d)   Building a high-trust society.                                                                        Part 1 Introduction | 7","Global and Regional Trends         and Prospects            Various inter-related international trends projected over the medium term were         considered for the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017-2022.           Economic Trends          Global economic growth is assumed to remain sluggish without an immediate         prospect of renewed vigor. The outlook is clouded by uncertainty on the policy         stance of the United States’ (US).          The slowdown in emerging markets, including China, is expected to continue.         However, the ASEAN-5 is expected to recover from this slowdown, with an average         growth of 5.4 percent in 2017-2022.          Global trade is expected to improve slightly, growing by 3.9 percent annually over         the period 2017-2022. The rise of global production networks and buying chains,         among other trends, will further drive integration.          Over  the  medium  term,  global  foreign  direct  investment  flows  are  projected  to         surpass US$1.8 trillion in 2018, reflecting an increase in global growth.          Monetary policy in the US will likely move towards normalization, while those in         the European Union and Japan will be accommodative to support the recovery of         their economies.          Political Trends           The political landscape will continue to be affected by the backlash resulting from         the global financial crisis (GFC). Already, the GFC has given rise to populist and         protectionist regimes, like the United Kingdom’s “Brexit” referendum results and         the US election results.           The  Middle  East  will  probably  continue  to  be  a  region  of  instability,  while  the         Philippine claim on the West Philippine Sea is likely to remain unresolved.               8 | Abridged Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022","Social and Demographic Trends               The number of senior citizens in the world is projected to grow to 1.4 billion by             2030, accounting for more than 25 percent of the populations in Europe and             Northern America, 20 percent in Oceania, 17 percent in Asia and Latin America,             and 6 percent in Africa. The Philippines will remain relatively young for some time.              Inequality may persist in some nations but is likely to decline as many low- and             middle-income countries grow faster than rich ones.              Innovation is predicted to originate in middle-income economies with strong             research and development base, although there is a shift towards private funding             from public spending.              Promising  new technologies  such as  big  data analytics,  the  internet  of things,             nanomaterials, and even blockchain technology may potentially disrupt and change             the way things are done.              Environmental Trends              There is a wide consensus among professionals about gradually rising temperatures             and climate volatility. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,             average global temperature increased by 0.85 C between 1880 and 2002, resulting                                                 o             in significant yield reductions on major crops such as wheat and maize. The world’s             oceans also continue to warm and polar ice caps continue to melt. Average sea levels             are predicted at 24-30 cm by 2065.              The Paris Agreement of 2015 seeks to address climate change although potential             changes  in  US  policy  could  undermine  implementation.  Nevertheless,  the  local             impact of climate change is driving stakeholders to push for sustainable development.                                                                                     Part 1 Introduction | 9","Overlay of Economic Growth,         Demographic Trends, and Physical          Characteristics             Economic and Demographic Trends          Total population in the Philippines has increased to around 101 million as of 2015.         By 2020, the population is expected to grow to around 110 million. This amounts to         an average annual population growth rate of 1.6 percent from 2015.         CALABARZON followed by NCR and Central Luzon have the largest populations         and are predicted to remain so by 2022 and even beyond. The Philippines has 33         highly-urbanized cities, with NCR, Metro Cebu, Metro Davao, and Metro Cagayan         de Oro having the largest populations.          Regions with higher gross regional domestic product also have higher populations.         CALABARZON, NCR, and Central Luzon account for 62.3 percent of GDP, while         ARMM (0.7%), Caraga (1.3%), and MIMAROPA (1.6%) are the lowest contributors.          The National Spatial Strategy           The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) will guide public investments and catalyze         private investments to maximize agglomeration efficiencies, enhance connectivity,         and build up resilience against natural hazards.          Agglomeration.  The NSS seeks to build on the efficiencies and maximize the         benefits of scale and agglomeration economies (i.e. firms and institutions locating         closer together). The NSS considered the trends and projections in population and         economic growth across regions, sub-regions, and cities. Thereafter, metropolitan,         regional, and  even  sub-regional  centers  have  been  identified.  In  general,  these         centers are meant to be engines of growth and hubs for development of surrounding         areas.          Connectivity. The NSS also seeks to improve linkages among settlements and the         centers in order to equalize opportunities and address socioeconomic inequities.          Resilience. Major centers and settlements need to be more resilient against natural         calamities. There should be multiple routes to and from these major centers and          10 | Abridged Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022","settlements; infrastructure and mode of transport in these alternative routes will be             guided by geohazards maps.  The intent is to prevent the loss of lives and property,             and minimize disruptions in economic activity even with the onslaught of natural             calamities.               Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022              Overall Framework                We are building a future where every Filipino enjoys a matatag, maginhawa, at             panatag na buhay. Just like any building construction, we begin by laying down a             strong foundation for more inclusive growth, a high-trust and resilient society, and             a globally-competitive knowledge economy. The impact will be manifested in the             following outcomes:                 •   The Philippines will be an upper middle-income country by 2022.                •   Growth will be more inclusive as manifested by a lower poverty incidence                    in rural areas – from 30 percent in 2015 to 20 percent in 2022.                •   The Philippines will have a high level of human development by 2022.                •   The unemployment rate will decline from 5.5 percent to 3-5 percent in                    2022.                •   There will be greater trust in government and in society.                •   Individuals and communities will be more resilient.                •   Filipinos will have greater drive for innovation.              These foundational outcomes should be able to support the succeeding medium-             term plans, all the way to 2040 and beyond.               Strategic Outcomes               A matatag, maginhawa, at panatag na buhay by 2040 will be achieved if we are             able to lay down the foundation for inclusive growth, a high-trust and resilient             society, and a globally-competitive knowledge economy by 2022. This goal will be             supported by three pillars - Malasakit, Pagbabago, and Patuloy na Pag-unlad - which             are further supported by strategic policies and macroeconomic fundamentals, and             built on a solid bedrock of safety, peace and security, infrastructure, and a healthy             environment.                                                                      Part 1 Introduction | 11","The major strategic outcomes are the following:                                           Pillar 1: Enhancing the social fabric (Malasakit): There will be greater trust in         public institutions and across all of society.  Government will be people-centered,         clean, and efficient.  Administration of justice will be swift and fair.  There will be         greater awareness about and respect for the diversity of our cultures.          Pillar 2: Inequality-reducing transformation (Pagbabago): There will be greater         economic opportunities, coming from the domestic market and the rest of the         world.  Access to these opportunities will be made easier. Special attention will be         given to the disadvantaged subsectors and people groups.          Pillar 3: Increasing growth potential (Patuloy na Pag-unlad): Many more will         adopt modern technology, especially for production. Innovation will be further         encouraged, especially in keeping with the harmonized research and development         agenda. And in order to accelerate economic growth even more in the succeeding         Plan periods, interventions to manage population growth will be implemented and         investments for human capital development will be increased.          Enabling and supportive economic environment: There will be macroeconomic         stability, supported by strategic trade and fiscal policies.  A strong and credible         competition policy will level the playing field and encourage more investments.       12 | Abridged Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022","Bedrock: There will be significant progress in the pursuit of just and lasting peace,             security, public order, and safety. Construction of strategic infrastructure that             promotes growth, equity, and regional development will be accelerated. At the             same time, there will be stronger institutions and more effective protocols to ensure             ecological integrity, clean and healthy environment.                Structure of the PDP Document              The PDP document is organized into seven parts following the PDP 2017-2022             Overall Strategic Framework.  The full document can be accessed online at http://             pdp.neda.gov.ph.              Part 1 provides the overall context for the Plan. Part 2 is about enhancing the social             fabric (Malasakit) to build the foundations for a high-trust society. Part 3 stresses             the importance of reducing inequalities in economic development opportunities             (Pagbabago). Part 4 focuses on increasing growth potential (Patuloy na Pag-             unlad). Part 5 calls for a supportive economic environment that will enable the             economy to sustain growth, and Part 6 is about foundations for inclusive and             sustainable development. Finally, Part 7 describes the institutional arrangements             for implementation and monitoring — making sure that what is planned is             implemented and that timely adjustments are done.              Each chapter of the PDP enumerates the target outcomes, together with measurable             indicators and levels desired.  These are elaborated further in the Results Matrices,             which can be accessed at www.neda.gov.ph/philippine-development-plan-results-             matrices-2. Strategies to attain the target outcomes are supported by public             investments, as contained in the Public Investment             Program 2017-2022  (www.neda.gov.ph/public-             investment-programs).              The PDP also contains a set of reforms requiring             legislation. A section on Legislative Agenda is added             to each chapter to be submitted to the Legislative-             Executive Development Advisory Council for             consideration.              In June 2017, the President issued EO 27 directing             “all departments, offices, and instrumentalities             of the national government” to undertake efforts             leading to the full implementation of the PDP 2017-             2022 (Refer to Annex 2 for full text).                                                                    Part 1 Introduction | 13","2         ENHANCING THE SOCIAL                       FABRIC (“MALASAKIT”)             A basic requirement for inclusive development is that our peoples are proud of being         Filipino and that they fully trust their government.  Hence, it will need Malasakit at         both ends – from government and from the citizens.          By 2022, there will be greater trust between the people and government. At the same         time, key reforms in the justice system will be done to reduce delays and cost to         those who seek justice at all levels (community/barangay, police, fiscal/prosecution,         and the courts).

For 2017-2022, the             government seeks to lay down the foundation of an economic growth that can be             further accelerated and sustained beyond the six years of the Duterte administration.              With the goal of laying down a robust foundation for a sustainable economic growth,             the Increasing Growth Potential or Patuloy na Pag-unlad pillar of the Philippine             Development Plan (PDP) 2017-2022 will employ strategies that will help in (a)             pursuing an efficient population management to enable its citizens to be productive             and engaged in economic activities and (b) promoting science, technology use, and             innovation to drive long-term growth of the economy.              Both strategies are new additions to the PDP, as the government acknowledges             the importance of harnessing the vast potential of a well-managed population             and vigorously advancing science, technology, and innovation (STI) in pursuing             sustainable economic growth.                Reaching for the Demographic Dividend               The age structure of the country’s population             matters in pursuing economic growth. In this vein,             the government intends to aggressively manage its             population such that people of working age will             comprise the bulk of the population (that results             from demographic transition). To reap what is called             the  demographic  dividend  from  this  transition,             the    government  will  ensure  that  this  workforce             will be productive so that it can well support the             dependents comprising the young and old.             The PDP 2017-2022 aims to accelerate the demographic transition. Gains from the             demographic dividend will be maximized, with citizens kept healthy and provided             with adequate education and skills for them to be highly productive.

To reduce mortality rates         The government will implement a sustained universal health care program         specifically addressed to:             •   Reduce infant and child deaths; and             •   Reduce maternal deaths (See PDP Chapter 11 for other strategies).          To reduce fertility rates         The main strategy will focus on assisting couples and individuals achieve their         desired family size through responsible parenthood and informed choice. In         particular, interventions will aim to:             •   Address unmet demand for family planning and unwanted pregnancies.             •   Increase age at first birth.             •   Increase birth spacing.           Gains from the demographic dividend will be maximized by investing in service         deliveries to boost the quality of human capital in the country and increase the         saving rates of Filipino households.           To improve the quality of human capital (See also PDP Chapter 10)             •   Increase investments in health initiatives for children, the workforce, and                family members.             •   Improve education processes and increase investments in education to                improve the quality of education.

The efficiency of the coordination depends on the adherence             to the intended outcomes, while the effectiveness of the plan is evaluated in terms             of the extent of improvement in quality of life of Filipinos, especially the poor and             marginalized.              The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Secretariat will             monitor headline indicators, at the national and sub-national levels – (a) real             gross domestic product growth; (b) real per capita income growth; (c) poverty and             subsistence rates in both rural and urban areas; and (d) employment outcomes –             using data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).              NEDA will also prioritize and sequence strategies, policies, and programs (including             proposed legislation) in coordination with implementing agencies. These will be             reported to the appropriate NEDA Board committees, Cabinet Clusters, and Inter-             Agency Committees, in addition to an annual Socioeconomic Report.              The various pillars of the PDP 2017-2022 shall be handled by various agencies and             committees who are assigned particular chapters in the Plan (Refer to PDP’s Table             21.1).
