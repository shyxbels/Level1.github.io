The terms “University  Textbook and Publications Board and the “University                        Textbook Board” for purposes of this set of guidelines may be used interchangeably                        and herein referred to as the “Board”.  While the main  concern of the Board is the print                        media prepared  by the University faculty and staff, it shall also include in its major                        responsibility  the  screening  of  electronically  aided  instructional  materials  such  as                        computer  multimedia  outputs,  process  software    and  the  like,  that  could  easily  be                        printed or reproduced  and distributed to the members of the academic  community.                          A.2.2.  Board Organization and Management                                The University Textbook Board shall be under the Office of the Vice President                        for Academic Affairs.  Membership to the Board shall be upon the recommendation of                        the  Vice  President  for  Academic  Affairs,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  University                        President. As stated in the University Code, the Board shall be composed of members                        representing the major disciplines in the University.                                The six major disciplines or groups of discipline to be represented in this Board                        shall include: a) Engineering and Information Technology; b) Agricultural Food and                        Natural Sciences; c) Physical Sciences; d) Education including Physical Education ; e)                        Social Sciences including Economics, Political Science, Languages and Humanities;                        and  f)  Medicines    including    Veterinary  Medicine  and  Nursing.    A    Development                        Specialist shall be designated as a non-voting member of the Board.                                Each member of the Board shall assume office for a term of four (4) years and                        renewable only once, at the discretion of the University President.                                The  Board  shall  implement  the  provisions  of  these  guidelines  and  may                        promulgate  new  or  additional  policies  that  the  members  deem  applicable  and                        necessary.  Two-thirds vote among the members in a regular meeting is required for a                        new or additional policy to be endorsed to the Academic Council or the Administrative                        Council depending on the nature of the policy.  The University President endorses the                        amendments to the University Board of Regents.                                The Board shall conduct at least two regular meetings in a quarter and conduct                        special  meetings  as  the  need  arises,  and  upon  recommendation  of  at  least  two                        members of the Board.  However, the Board Chairman shall have the special power to                        call a meeting anytime he deems necessary.                                The chairman of the Board shall preside over all regular and special meetings.                                In case the chairmanship becomes vacant, the members shall select a new                        Chairman  who  shall  serve  office  for  the  remainder  of  the  term  of  the  previous                        Chairman.","The  Chairman  of  the  Board  shall  designate  one  of  the  members  as  Board                        Secretary who shall take the minutes of the meetings, publish the same and prepare                        announcements  for  regular  and  special  meetings  and  perform  other  secretarial                        functions that the Board may require.  One special function of the Board Secretary is                        to establish linkages with book publishers and with other state colleges and universities                        and  particularly  with  the Philippine Association of State Colleges and Universities                        (PASUC) regarding book publishing.                                The  Board  shall  be  provided  initially  with  at  least  one  clerical  staff  and  a                        computer lay-out specialist.                         A.2.3.  Preparation of Materials                                All members of the faculty and staff of the University shall be encouraged to                        prepare materials for publication. These shall include textbooks, laboratory manuals,                        modules and the like, and electronic aided instruction media output.  The Board may                        commission an individual or group to write the history of the school, and biographies                        of  important  school  personages.    The  Board  may  also  commission  philosophical                        treatise and the writing of an extensive research that may be used as references for                        classroom purposes.                                The  Board  shall  also  encourage  the  preparation  of  non-print  instructional                        materials such as scale models, preserved specimens and shall promulgate guidelines                        for the recognition and in incentives to quality non-print instructional materials.                                All writers should be careful about what they write.  They should be thoroughly                        familiar with intellectual property rights particularly those on plagiarism and laws on                        libel.  The Board shall not consider  for review and publication compiled lecture notes                        if this does not exhibit originality and / or not compiled with proper citations length /                        volume of the materials  or any other benefits that the Board of Regents and other                        government agencies may allow.  The pro – rated award shall be as follows:                         1)  Textbook, single author – up to 4 months                                       Contributor – up to 3 months                         2)  Laboratory manual/module, single author – up to 4 months                                      Contributor – up to 2 months                                The  Board  may  recommend  to  the  University  Administrative  Council  other                        alternative incentives or remuneration to the members of the Board subject to approval                        by the Board of Regents.                         A.2.4.  Review, Testing, and Editing                                The member of the Board to review the manuscript of a writer shall be well                        qualified and whose field of interest and specialization is the subject of the manuscript.                        In certain cases, the Board member concerned may recommend an external reviewer                        who shall be paid appropriate honorarium.  The Board may commission a technical                        review  team  for  manuscripts  containing  highly  technical  procedures,  higher  level                        statistical tests and those that require computer software testing.                                In all cases, any publishable material from any college shall be endorsed to the                        Board by the department chairman and the college dean.","The Editor-in-chief may create an appropriate student task force to assist him                        in the review.                                It should be emphasized that the task for review shall only be on the content                        appropriateness, comprehensiveness, and readability.                                The  Board  Chairman,  if  he  is  qualified,  may  perform  the  editing  of  the                        manuscript or he may commission a qualified reviewer and editor.                                The Board shall establish readability level for textbooks, laboratory manuals,                        and modules.  For this purpose, the Board shall sponsor a seminar – workshop for                        determining readability scores of manuscripts.                         A.2.5.  Publication                                No  instructional  material  in  the  University  may  be  submitted  for  publication                        unless endorsed by at least two-thirds of the members of the Board.                                The University Printing Office shall be given priority for the printing of university                        instructional materials.  However, in order to perform this vital task, the expertise of the                        staff  should  be  upgraded  and  newer  models  of  higher  capacity  printers  should  be                        acquired.    Initially,  publishers  outside  the  university  may  be  contacted  to  publish                        university instructional materials.                                Different  publishers  have  different  arrangements  and  incentives  to  authors.                        The  Board  therefore,  shall  give  preference  to  publishers  that  can  offer  the  most                        advantageous arrangement for the authors (s).                                Publishers  establish  their  own  rule  of  thumb  for  royalty  to  authors.    If  the                        material  is used only on a  limited or just university  –  wide scale, publishers might                        establish very low royalty or even charge the University for the materials.                                In the long term, the University Printing Office is still the best option to facilitate                        publication of University instructional materials.                                In the long term, the University Printing Office is still the best option to facilitate                        publication of University instructional materials.                                University faculty and staff who have established themselves as authors may                        directly  contact  their  own  publishers.    However,  materials  to  be  published  as                        instructional  materials  in  the  University  would  have  to  pass  through  the  Board  for                        review and monitoring purposes.                                All materials published by University faculty and staff should be registered with                        the  National  Library  in  order  to  protect  the  author(s)  from  intellectual  piracy.    The                        publishers may do this themselves or the material could be registered through the                        University designated liaison officer with the National Library.                         A.2.6.  Screening of Instructional Materials                               Instructional materials that have been endorsed to the Board by the Department                        Chairman and the College Deans concerned for publication are deemed to have been                        screened for use by students and other end-users.","Reference materials such s adopted textbooks and laboratory manuals would                        have to be screened by the Board.  The Board Chairman may designate appropriate                        Board member to screen the materials that are  within their areas of expertise.                               No  locally  and  foreign  prepared  textbook,    laboratory  manual  or  any  other                        instructional material or other print materials prepared by non-CvSU faculty  member                        shall be adopted for classroom use by any member of the faculty in the University                        without the approval for adoption by the Board.  Along with this, the list of reference                        materials to be purchased by the University should have the recommendation of the                        Chairman of the Textbook Board.                         A.2.7.  Sale of Published Instructional Materials                               Compilation of hand-outs of instructional materials that are prepared with the                        use of the university facilities using university funds should not be sold to students but                        shall be distributed free of charge.  In case of voluminous hand-outs or lecture notes                        compilations,  the  teacher  may  provide  the  University  Printing  Office  or  private                        photocopy shops with the original copies of these hand-outs.  Students may have                        photocopies of these materials at their own expense and at their own risk.                               No    teacher   shall   be   allowed   to   personally   and   independently                        produce/print/photocopy any instructional material and sell these to students.                               No teacher shall compel any student n to purchase a required textbook, nor                        require a student to submit a copy of the same book or any other book as a requirement                        of the course.                               Required  laboratory  manuals  written  by  members  of  the  University  faculty                        should be purchased only from the Marketing Center and not from any other source.                              The Board may determine the cost of instructional materials published in the                        University  Printing  Office.    Costing  arrangements  should  be  made  with  outside                        publishers of university instructional materials.  In all cases, the lowest affordable price                        to students should be determined and shall prevail.                               All  materials  published  through  the  University  Printing  Office  shall  be  sold                        through the Marketing Center and should be marked with CvSU Office of Business                        Affairs.
