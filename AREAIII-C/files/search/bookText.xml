               I. SHORT BACKGROUND / DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY




                       The Philippines has started to make headway in education through the policies  that

               aim to expand access and improve quality. The need for human capital development has been

               the main motivation behind such educational reforms, as detailed in the current

               administration’s Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017-2022. Despite notable gains, work

               remains, especially in terms of academic performance, the number of educational facilities


               and participation rates. To address these issues, the government has significantly increased

               education expenditure over the years, initiated structural changes in basic and higher

               education, and intensified partnerships with the private sector and industry.

                       The education system consists of the three components: basic education, higher

               education and the technical and vocational education and training (TVET). The basic

               education directed by the Department of Education (DepEd) has undergone a major change


               in which Kindergarten is mandated in the elementary curriculum and the Enhanced Basic

               Education Act of 2013, also known as the K-12 law, made attending secondary school

               mandatory  and  extended  the  curriculum  by  two  years.  On  other  hand,  higher  education]]></page><page Index="324"><![CDATA[directed by the Commission of Higher Education (CHED) which includes undergraduate and

               postgraduate programs.

                       Technology has made it possible for us to gain access to diverse and abundant

               information. Students can harness this, evaluate which ones are accurate and have

               significance, and use it to address a certain issue. Alternative Delivery Modes (ADM) was

               implemented by DepEd to address the problem on classroom congestion and other situations


               and circumstances which prevent children from going to and staying in school.

                       Virtual learning is a learning experience that is enhanced through utilizing computers

               and/or internet both outside and inside the facilities of the educational organization. The

               instructions most commonly take place in an online environment the teaching activities are

               carried out online whereby the teachers and learners are physically separated.

                       According to Tech Target (2019), a virtual learning environment (VLE) could be a set


               of teaching and learning tools designed to reinforce a student's learning expertise together

               with computers and also the web within the learning method. The principal parts of a VLE

               package embrace information mapping, student following, on-line support for each teacher

               and student, transmission (e-mail, rib discussions, chat, net publishing), and web links to

               outside information resources.

                       In addition, Koskela et al. (2005) found out, that the number of latest virtual learning


               environments (VLEs) is increasing and that are being publicized as an answer for remote and

               cross-border education. Students will perform a large vary of exercises with a computer-based

               learning setting. This can be extraordinarily necessary once the tasks cannot be experienced

               in reality, as an example because of their unsafe nature.

                       In the Philippine, the concept of e-Learning is relatively new due to lack of infrastructure

               and high cost of internet access. Public education suffers from shortages or lack of computers

               and internet access. However, the high regard for better quality education among Filipinos can


               be manifested on various government programs and policies that promote online learning into

               curriculum development.]]></page><page Index="325"><![CDATA[Methods of Research subject is one of the subjects injected in all the programs in  the

               tertiary education. It aims to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills through

               qualitative and quantitative research for college students regardless of their program.

                       Research and development (R & D) is one of the necessary fields for an industry or


               company to survive. Whether a new or established company, they need to invest in R & D, so

               what more for a country?

                       Innovation is a strategy needed to have a successful R & D, which requires innovative

               people. According to Patalinhug (2003), Philippine innovation system requires the

               collaboration of the university and relevant industry associated with the courses provided by

               the school. He further stressed, that students who are the future workers of the state will

               appreciate the importance of innovation, do a little bit of R & D activities.

                       Those points of view, were considered by the researchers, the reason for choosing

               Methods of Research subject to pilot VITLE.


                       With this, VITLE would focus on developing an alternative virtual learning program for

               college students in Methods of Research subject. Critical to achieving success in this area is

               the training of learners that includes providing appropriate instruction and continuing updates,

               considering the dynamic nature of developments in research.

                       The proposed alternative learning system is a virtual learning environment that could


               level up a modern-day method of teaching-leaning delivery that saves time and space, has

               economic value, and considers convenience of the teachers and learners.]]></page><page Index="326"><![CDATA[II. DETAILED ACCOMPLISHMENT REPORT

                                   Environment (V.I.T.L.E.) in Methods of Research Subject

                                                         Stage 1

                       The development process of V.I.T.L.E. in MoR is conducted using the agile method.

               Initially the researchers created the user interface (UI) of the website to visualize the flow and

               process of the system and to have an idea on how to approach the user experience (UX).





               Stage 2

                       Upon the finalization of the frontend of V.I.T.L.E. in MoR the researchers begin

               developing the functionality of the system together with its features. Integration and testing

               took place in this phase of the process and continues up until the researchers finalize the

               functionality development of the system and pass the integration and testing.]]></page><page Index="329"><![CDATA[Stage 3

                       The researchers commence a test run of the system to using localhost server to gather

               data regarding the performance of the system, after that the researchers gathered data from

               the test run to further improve the performance of the system inclined from the collected data

               from the test run. Test runs commence always after the researchers successfully applied the

               changes in the system up until the researchers finally reach the final phase of the process


               where all the features of the system are fully functional and the UI and UX are finalize, test

               runs are then concluded.





               Testing

                   Test runs are conducted by the researchers using a localhost server where the system is

               simulated and put through a series of testing for the researchers to see if there are bugs and

               errors in the systems functionality and interface.





               Research Objective 2:
                       The objective number 2 of the study is to develop the Virtual Interaction in Teaching


               and Learning Environment (V.I.T.L.E.) in Methods of Research Subject website as designed

               with the used of the framework Admin LTE and programming languages HTML, CSS and

               JavaScript.





               Data Collected: Completed




               Findings:

                       V.I.T.L.E. in MoR is developed using a website framework named Admin LTE with

               Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and JavaScript used to

               fully develop the frontend of the system which includes the UI and UX and Hypertext]]></page><page Index="330"><![CDATA[Preprocessor (PHP) and MySQL for the backend of the system where data can be added,

               visualizes the three main pages of the system after the login page which are the administrator

               panel, the instructor profile and the student profile.

                       After logging in using the administrators credentials the system will lead the user to the

               administrator panel where four tabs can be viewed, the overview tab, classes tab,  instructors]]></page><page Index="331"><![CDATA[tab and the students tab. In the default tab which is the overview, the administrator can see

               the summary of the systems data, that includes the total number of students, total number of

               instructors and the existing classes registered in the system as well as the instructors assigned

               in each class and the number of students in each class. In the classes tab, the administrator

               can view all of the registered classes in the system and also the admin can update the class

               as well as delete them. In the instructors tab the administrator can view all of the registered


               instructors account, the admin can also update the instructor’s account information, change

               its password and delete the account of the instructor. In the students tab the administrator can

               view all of the registered student’s account, the admin can also update the student’s account

               information, change its password and delete the account of the student.

                       In the instructor profile, three tabs can be viewed the activity tab, students tab and the

               quizzes tab. In the activity tab the instructor can view all of the currently uploaded lessons and

               quizzes for the class. In the students tab the instructor can view the full list of the registered


               students in his/her class and also monitor who’s online or offline. In the quizzes tab the

               instructor can view the quiz records of his/her students.

                       In the student profile the page only has one tab which is the activity tab, in here the

               students can view the uploaded lesson of their instructor and the students can download the

               learning material also the students can view and answer the quizzes uploaded also by their

               Capabilities and Limitations

                       The capabilities of Virtual Interaction in Teaching and Learning Environment

               (V.I.T.L.E.) in Methods of Research Subject website are as follows:

                   1. It offers a new platform where instructors can further educate their students is a much


                       efficient and interactive manner.

                   2. Classes in this system can easily be managed by adding, updating and even deleting.
                   3. Instructors and students in this system can easily be managed by adding, updating,


                       changing password and even deleting,

                   4. `monitoring the classes, instructors and student using this system provides

                       convenience with the use of the administrator panel overview.

                   5. Interaction from the instructor to student and vice versa is made possible by the chat

                       feature of the system.


                   6. Instructors can upload their PDF file learning materials as well as quizzes in the system

                       for the students.

                   7. Instructors can easily manage their lessons by adding, viewing, downloading and/or

                       deleting it, as for quizzes the instructors can add, view and/or even delete it.

                   8. Instructors  can easily  register  new students to her  class  in  case  a  student  is  not


                       automatically registered by the administrator.

               Data Collected: Not Completed




               IV. INSIGHTS


                        We have encountered quiet a lot of challenges along the way in doing this research,

               one of such is the lack of knowledge in this particular branch of information technology which

               is web development. Not everything is taught inside the four corners of our lecture rooms or

               laboratories, we know that but learning things during this classes is not just the only thing that

               is important we know then realize that picking a certain field in your degree where you can

               utilize your skills at most is necessary when it comes to choosing a topic of your research.

                        Lacking the skill set we need to conclude this research force us to seek new and


               different sources of learning focused in web development to gain the knowledge that our

               research requires.




                        Finalizing our research is a much harder due to the restrictions on the things that we

               can do freely due to the implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) as

               precaution to the COVID-19 pandemic. These restrictions dramatically decreased the rate of


               our progress in these recent months and press us to communicate online. Truly no one can

               delay    the    future    and    the    future    calls    for    the    new    normal    to    be  adapted.]]></page><page Index="356"><![CDATA[Overall, our journey in concluding this research is an irregular, challenging and

               unexpected but at the same time necessary and fruitful.

                           January 30-31, 2019, International House 1, CvSU-Main Campus



               Objectives

               The activity aims to provide the faculty members the latest trends in Higher Education 4.0, as
               well as research and extension, in order to help them provide high quality instruction, develop
               and pursue advanced research activities, and design and conduct extension activities that will
               empower people and communities.

               Rationale


               The Higher Education 4.0 trends and future perspectives for teaching and learning are equally
               affected by the rapid changes we are facing today. These trends are significant to meet the
               future needs and challenges in education through the pervasive application of Information and
               Communication Technology (ICT).

               Discussion and dissemination of Higher Education 4.0 could enhance teachers’ capability
               since 74 percent of the faculty members in the T3 Campuses are not an education graduate
               and/or do not belong in any professional education organization that could aid in the
               discussion.

               To date, only 13 percent of the T3 Campuses faculty members are engaged in research
               activity because some do not have enough understanding and enlightenment on the research
               proposal preparation. Although all permanent faculty members are involved in community
               activities/services, they have limited knowledge on how to prepare a comprehensive extension
               activity proposal.


               Overview


               On January 30-31, 2019, the teachers and staff of the T3 Campuses, Tanza, General Trias
               City, and Trece Martires City, joined together for this semester’s Teachers’ Capability
               Enhancement Seminar Workshop at International House I, Cavite State University, Indang
               Cavite from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The two-day seminar workshop featured five guest
               speakers who covered various topics promoting the growth and development of teachers in
               the academe.

               The capability enhancement seminar was designed to promote continuous development of
               teachers as they gear up for the second semester of school year 2018-2019. The guest
               speakers who tackled various topics that centered on becoming effective teachers in our
               country’s relatively new period of outcomes-based education and technology-driven teaching
               strategy, successfully prepped the T3 faculty in their various departments for the many
               challenges that lay ahead of them this semester.]]></page><page Index="480"><![CDATA[Day 1

               By Suzette A. Quesada-Magano, Ph.D.

               The 1 Cavite Arduino Technology Research Forum and Exhibit was held on April 22, 2019
                    st
               from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the Santiago M. Rolle Hall, CvSU-Main Campus, Indang Cavite.
               The event was organized by the Office of the Vice-President for Research and Extension
               (OVPRE) and College of Engineering and Information Technology, with the help of a number of
               sponsors: American Spaces Philippines, Fablab Manila, Sparkfruit Electronics, LEENTECH
               Network Solutions, RoboRAVE Philippines, and LITL.

               The said activity’s aim was to expose students and teachers to an event where they could
               accomplish the following goals: exhibit and present their Arduino-based research, interact and
               collaborate with other Cavite schools as well as nearby cities and provinces, and update
               themselves on the current application of Arduino technology on instruction, research, enterprise,
               and information technology. The local research forum was conducted in preparation for a much
               bigger event in the near future: an international conference to be held at CvSU in 2020. The  said
               future project was meant to be accomplished in partnership with the American Center,  Manila
               and American Spaces Philippines.

               The program began with a doxology led by Pamela Daphne R. Busog, CvSU-Trece Martires
               City Campus Extension Coordinator, followed by the singing of the Philippine National Anthem
               led by Steven G. Quisto, a BS Information Technology student. The opening remarks were
               given by T3 Campus Administrator, Prof. Noel A. Sedigo and the introduction of the CvSU
               Administration Council by Prof. Allan Robert C. Solis, Director of the Public Information and
               Community Relations Office. Messages to the seminar’s participants were given by the following
               guest speakers: Dr. David L. Cero, Dean of the College of Engineering and Information
               Technology, Dr. Camilo A. Polinga, Vice President for Academic Affairs, Dr. Ruel M. Mojica,
               Vice President for Research and Extension, and the University’s very own president, Dr.
               Hernando D. Robles. The certificate for the keynote speaker was awarded by the University
               President himself, together with the T3 Campus Administrator, Prof. Sedigo.

               T3 MIS Officer Keno A. Villavicencio introduced the first keynote speaker, Richard F.
               Prodigalidad, President and CEO of LEENTECH Network Solutions, a company that specializes
               in mobile application design and development, digital marketing and consultation, and cloud
               server and management solutions. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between LEENTECH
               and Cavite State University was signed afterwards. The morning plenary session featured the
               following topics: Arduino, Education, and Training (led by guest speaker Arvin S. Buendia,
               Robotics Specialist for the CIIT College of Arts and Technology and author of a few Arduino-
               based robotics textbooks), Arduino Integration on Laboratory Instruction (led by Keno A.
               Villavicencio, IT instructor of CvSU-T3 and Arduino-based research presenter for the 2019
               International Conference on Open and Distance e-Learning in Taiwan), Arduino Local and
               International Competitions (led by Mervin A. Boco, Robotics Coordinator of Tagaytay City
               Science High School and International and National Robotics Competitions Champion and
               Awardee in Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia, and the Philippines).

               For the afternoon session, participating schools and companies featured their works in the
               Arduino oral-based and display-based project presentation portion, followed by the competition
               named “Arduinothon.” The next keynote speaker was Jeanie M. Duwan, Assistant Cultural
               Affairs Officer for the US Embassy, who was later proceeded by a new set of guest speakers for
               the following topics for discussion: American Spaces (led by Xavier E. Lara, Director of
               American Spaces Philippines), Arduino International Association and Events (led by Michael]]></page><page Index="515"><![CDATA[Julius G. Hayag, Director of RoboRAVE Philippines), and Arduino Fabrication, Enterprise, and
               Markets (led by Engr. Cezar R. Calayo, General Manager of CRV Embedded System Design for
               Sparkfruit Electronics Enterprise and Fablab Manila). The certificates were then awarded by
               Prof. Noel A. Sedigo, Pamela Daphne R. Busog, adviser for the student organization, League of
               IT Leaders, Roncesvalle J. Caipang, T3 Research Coordinator, and Joyce Erika S. Senaris, T3
               Chairperson for the Department of Information Technology.

               The awards for the winners of the Arduino-based Oral Presentation competition, the Arduino-
               based Display Presentation competition, and the Arduinothon were given after the awarding of
               the certificate to the second keynote speaker, while the closing remarks were given by Keno A.
               Villavicencio, the overall in-charge of the said event. The forum and exhibit was concluded by
               the singing of the CvSU hymn led by Pamela Daphne R. Busog.

               The theme of the event, “Translating Ideas into Innovation” paved the way for interesting
               avenues for discussion among IT practitioners and aspiring professionals, which gave the
               participants of the forum a glimpse into the competitive world of the IT industry. Joseph O.
               Sabaybay, CvSU-Tanza Campus IT Instructor and participant of the Arduino forum, had great
               things to say about his experience of the said event: “The first Cavite Arduino technology
               research forum and exhibit was a great and informative seminar as well as a good platform for
               students to showcase their talents and passion for robotics and the like, especially for the
               younger students—those in senior high school. Through the effort of Sir Keno, we became
               connected and had a MOA with local and international companies and the government that
               deals with Arduino technology.” The event was indeed a success as it established solidarity
               among students, practitioners, and enthusiasts of Arduino technology in the IT industry—a
               hopeful turnout at a time where young professionals are expected to become more competitive
               in the digital world.]]></page><page Index="516"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="517"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="518"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="519"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="520"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="521"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="522"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="523"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="524"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="525"><![CDATA[]]></page><page Index="526"><![CDATA[BSIT Students shared their expertise and

               Objectives

               The activity aims to provide the faculty members the latest trends in Higher Education 4.0, as
               well as research and extension, in order to help them provide high quality instruction, develop
               and pursue advanced research activities, and design and conduct extension activities that will
               empower people and communities.

               Rationale


               The Higher Education 4.0 trends and future perspectives for teaching and learning are equally
               affected by the rapid changes we are facing today. These trends are significant to meet the
               future needs and challenges in education through the pervasive application of Information and
               Communication Technology (ICT).

               Discussion and dissemination of Higher Education 4.0 could enhance teachers’ capability
               since 74 percent of the faculty members in the T3 Campuses are not an education graduate
               and/or do not belong in any professional education organization that could aid in the
               discussion.

               To date, only 13 percent of the T3 Campuses faculty members are engaged in research
               activity because some do not have enough understanding and enlightenment on the research
               proposal preparation. Although all permanent faculty members are involved in community
               activities/services, they have limited knowledge on how to prepare a comprehensive extension
               activity proposal.


               Overview


               On January 30-31, 2019, the teachers and staff of the T3 Campuses, Tanza, General Trias
               City, and Trece Martires City, joined together for this semester’s Teachers’ Capability
               Enhancement Seminar Workshop at International House I, Cavite State University, Indang
               Cavite from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The two-day seminar workshop featured five guest
               speakers who covered various topics promoting the growth and development of teachers in
               the academe.

               The capability enhancement seminar was designed to promote continuous development of
               teachers as they gear up for the second semester of school year 2018-2019. The guest
               speakers who tackled various topics that centered on becoming effective teachers in our
               country’s relatively new period of outcomes-based education and technology-driven teaching
               strategy, successfully prepped the T3 faculty in their various departments for the many
               challenges that lay ahead of them this semester.]]></page><page Index="586"><![CDATA[Day 1

                       Cavite State University – T3 Campuses held the Students’ Virtual Orientation  on

               students and to enlighten them about the “new normal” academic set-up of T3
               Campuses. During the open forum, various questions were raised by the students and

               were answered by Prof. Noel A. Sedigo, T3 Campus Administrator, and other key

               officials.

               Rationale
                       On 08 March 2020, through Proclamation No. 922 s, 2020, the country was declared
               in a state of public health emergency because of the outbreak of Corona Virus  Disease
               (COVID-19).
                       Another Proclamation No. 929 on 16 March 2020 was released declaring a state of
               calamity throughout the Philippines because of COVID-19 pandemic.
                       With these and the Inter-agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging
               Infectious Diseases (IATF) Resolutions, Commission on Higher Education released CHED
               COVID Advisory No. 7, providing guidelines on the HEIs operation and work arrangements.
               The use of flexible learning delivery mode was also provided for guidance.
                       Cavite State University through the Academic Affairs Unit continuously provide
               webinars and trainings to prepare the faculty members with the flexible learning and other
               alternative modes of delivery for the AY 2020-2021. And with the series of webinars and
               trainings, the CvSU T3 Campuses come up with different strategies on how flexible learning
               will be possible.
                       Together with the faculty members, students and parents should also be informed on
               how the flexible learning will be conducted in the First Semester, AY 2020-2021 through an
               orientation.


               Objectives
                       The activity aimed to provide a clearer understanding on how the flexible learning  will
               be conducted in the T3 Campuses for the First Semester, AY 2020-2021 and at the same time
               come up with a united desire on how to provide quality education to students despite the
               pandemic.


               Program of Activities
                       The program started at 1:30PM by a prayer followed by the CvSU at a Glance video

               Question and Answer
               Question (BSP 1-Trece): Do we need books in our subjects?
               Answer (Ms. Feranil): Books are not required, but there are books which are already reviewed,
               evaluated, and approved by the University Textbook Board especially in General Education
               subjects that may be used as references.

               Question (BSP 1-Trece): Do we need to pay any fees?
               Answer (Ms. Feranil): No fees will be collected because of the RA 10931 or the Free Tertiary
               Education.


               Question (Tanza Student): Who will decide on the type of platform to use in learning, whether
               CvSU eLearning o Google classroom, is it the student?
               Answer (Ms. Villavicencio): Faculty members will define the type of platform to use.

               Question (First Year-Trece): What will happen to those students who are qualified for
               admission but did not able to submit original admission requirements?
               Answer (Ms. Anonas): Students are temporary enrolled unless original admission
               requirements are submitted.]]></page><page Index="632"><![CDATA[Question (Tanza Student): Are you going to provide each student an account to access the
               eLearning System?
               Answer (Ms. Busog): Yes, but we are still waiting for the account from Main Campus.

               Question (BSP 1-Trece): How would be the distribution of modules and submission of activities
               for those who prefer modular mode of learning?
               Answer (Ms. Feranil): There are assigned day for each program, for the pickup of learning
               materials and submission of activities in the campus as stated in the virtual class  schedule
               provided.

               Question (BSBM-Trece): What will happen if we are taking online quiz, and there were
               technical interruptions, is the system capable of saving the status of our quiz?
               Answer (Ms. Banag): Yes, it may be saved. The Instructor will just set the time for the quiz.

               Question (BSIT Parent): Will the University provide the students with a copy of University
               Academic Calendar and the tutorial on how to use the system and take the examinations?
               Answer (Mr. Villavicencio): Yes, calendar will be provided to students through Facebook page
               the same with the tutorial which was presented earlier. Since this orientation is in FB Live,
               students may review or replay the tutorial anytime since this will not be deleted anymore. And
               at the same time, during the first week of class orientation, Instructors will discuss again the
               process of using the learning platform.

               Question (BSHRM-Trece): When will we have our OJT which are scheduled last Midterm?
               Answer (Ms. Sidamon): OJTs are allowed if it is online.


               Question (GenTri Student): I am a working student; can I still attend to online classes?
               Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Yes, you may. Because we discourage synchronous classes.

               Question (Trece Student): Are the learning materials downloadable?
               Answer (Mr. Ty): Yes, all learning materials once uploaded to the platform are ready for
               download anytime as long as you have your device.

               Question (First Year Student): Are we required to attend online class in uniform? Do we need
               to buy one?
               Answer (Ms. Feranil): No, just wear appropriate outfit that is appealing to the class.

               Question (Gen. Trias Student): How sure that the answers to online exams taken by students
               are authentic, since they could search the net while taking the exam?
               Answer (Mr. Villavicencio): College set up is different from high school or senior high school.
               Examinations are skill based and not knowledge based only. Questions can be reshuffled,
               have timer and other strategies, your instructors may set it.


               Question: Which is the best mode of learning?
               Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Modular mode of learning are very risky for everyone. Since, there are
               limited transportation and at the same time there is increasing number of COVID cases in the
               area. But if you really prefer the modular type, modules will be available in a designated area
               in the campus entrance where you can get your modules. But if you want it to be delivered to
               your doorsteps, yes, it is possible, but you will shoulder the cost of shipping. But we cannot
               give you the whole semester module because that is so many pages. That is why we
               discourage the modular type of learning. Unlike online, materials will be uploaded to the LMS
               or Google classroom or could be send to you through fb messenger, chat groups, email or
               even text messages. Synchronous classes are discouraged, so meaning, if you will have the
               online, it is not necessary that you spend load for the data daily for zoom classes, no. We will
               have the asynchronous type of teaching and learning. Because our motto is NO ONE
               SHOULD BE LEFT BEHIND.
               Online is more advantageous, cheaper, or safer rather than modular.
               Another thing, we should also invest on this. Especially IT students, not only connectivity but
               also having a laptop is necessary in your program.]]></page><page Index="633"><![CDATA[Question (BSE Student): Do we have the qualifying examination schedule? If ever, will it be
               online?
               Answer (Mr. Ty): There are previous announcements that it will be scheduled in latter part.
               Answer (Prof. Sedigo): The qualifying exam is still face to face and is probably scheduled in
               January 2021.

               Question: Do we need to pay for the printing of modules?
               Answer (Mr. Ty): No payment. It is free for students because CHED paid for their tuition and
               school fees.

               Question (Gen. Trias Student): How about the academic scholars?
               Answer (Ms. Sidamon): Only Tulong Dulong and TES are active scholarship grant for this
               semester.

               Question (BSE Student): If we have 3-hour virtual class schedule, do we need to attend 3
               hours virtual class also?
               Answer (Ms. Feranil): No, we prepared the virtual class schedule for you to be aware of the
               available schedule for the teacher for consultation and possible queries or clarifications on the
               lesson. This flexible learning is a self-paced learning, so you can do the readings or studying
               in your convenient time not necessarily during the virtual class schedule. In addition,
               attendance is not part of the grading system for this semester.
               Answer (Prof. Sedigo): In addition, during virtual class schedule, that is the time that the
               teacher will post the lessons and made himself available to students’ consultations.

               Question (Parent): I am an OFW parent, can I monitor my child’s performance in the online
               learning platform?
               Answer (Ms. Busog): Yes, if the student will allow their parents to access his/her account,
               he/she will give the username and password of the student.

               Question (New Student): How can we meet our teachers? Are we going to look or contact
               them, or they are the one who will contact us?
               Answer (Ms. Feranil): Each section has assigned Registration Adviser. They are the one
               tasked to look for the students and create a group for the class. Then later, all subject teachers
               will be added to the group, so that there will be only one group for each class to elicit confusion
               on the part of the student on how to communicate and whom.

               Question (Irregular Student): How about if virtual class schedule is conflict with my back
               subjects, do I need to drop the subject?
               Answer (Ms. Anonas): No, flexible learning is self-paced and can do the learning even not
               during the virtual class schedule.

               Question: How will the lesson be delivered? Is the lesson/module will be provided for the whole
               semester one at a time?
               Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Preparing a module is not the easy but almost all faculty have their
               modules for one month or until Midterm except for some that they really have prepared the
               whole module for one semester. So module delivery, is by lesson or chapter, so that you will
               not be overwhelmed by the lessons and the activities.]]></page><page Index="634"><![CDATA[Program of Activities]]></page><page Index="635"><![CDATA[Evaluation Results
