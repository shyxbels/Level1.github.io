               the  main  motivation  behind  such  educational  reforms,  as  detailed  in  the  current

               administration’s Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017-2022. Despite notable gains, work

               remains, especially in terms of academic performance, the number of educational facilities

               and participation rates. To address these issues, the government has significantly increased

               education  expenditure  over  the  years,  initiated  structural  changes  in  basic  and  higher


               education, and intensified partnerships with the private sector and industry.

                       The  education  system  consists  of  the  three  components:  basic  education,  higher

               education  and  the  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  (TVET).  The  basic

               education directed by the Department of Education (DepEd) has undergone a major change

               in which Kindergarten is mandated in the elementary curriculum and the Enhanced Basic

               Education  Act  of  2013,  also  known  as  the  K-12  law,  made  attending  secondary  school

               mandatory  and  extended  the  curriculum  by  two  years.  On  other  hand,  higher  education]]></page><page Index="264"><![CDATA[directed by the Commission of Higher Education (CHED) which includes undergraduate and

               postgraduate programs.

                       Technology  has  made  it  possible  for  us  to  gain  access  to  diverse  and  abundant

               information.  Students  can  harness  this,  evaluate  which  ones  are  accurate  and  have


               significance, and use it to address a certain issue. Alternative Delivery Modes (ADM) was

               implemented by DepEd to address the problem on classroom congestion and other situations

               and circumstances which prevent children from going to and staying in school.

                       Virtual learning is a learning experience that is enhanced through utilizing computers

               and/or  internet  both  outside  and  inside  the  facilities  of  the  educational  organization.  The


               instructions most commonly take place in an online environment the teaching activities are

               carried out online whereby the teachers and learners are physically separated.

                       According to Tech Target (2019), a virtual learning environment (VLE) could be a set

               of teaching and learning tools designed to reinforce a student's learning expertise together

               with computers and also the web within the learning method. The principal parts of a VLE

               package embrace information mapping, student following, on-line support for each teacher

               and  student,  transmission  (e-mail,  rib  discussions,  chat,  net  publishing),  and  web  links  to


               outside information resources.

                       In addition, Koskela et al. (2005) found out, that the number of latest virtual learning

               environments (VLEs) is increasing and that are being publicized as an answer for remote and

               cross-border education. Students will perform a large vary of exercises with a computer-based

               learning setting. This can be extraordinarily necessary once the tasks cannot be experienced


               in reality, as an example because of their unsafe nature.

                       In the Philippine, the concept of e-Learning is relatively new due to lack of infrastructure

               and high cost of internet access. Public education suffers from shortages or lack of computers

               and internet access. However, the high regard for better quality education among Filipinos can

               be manifested on various government programs and policies that promote online learning into

               curriculum development.]]></page><page Index="265"><![CDATA[Methods of Research subject is one of the subjects injected in all the programs in the

               tertiary  education.  It  aims  to  develop  critical  thinking  and  problem-solving  skills  through

               qualitative and quantitative research for college students regardless of their program.

                       Research and development (R & D) is one of the necessary fields for an industry or


               company to survive. Whether a new or established company, they need to invest in R & D, so

               what more for a country?

                       Innovation is a strategy needed to have a successful R & D, which requires innovative

               people.  According  to  Patalinhug  (2003),  Philippine  innovation  system  requires  the

               collaboration of the university and relevant industry associated with the courses provided by


               the school. He further stressed, that students who are the future workers of the state will

               appreciate the importance of innovation, do a little bit of R & D activities.

                       Those points of view, were considered by the researchers, the reason for choosing

               Methods of Research subject to pilot VITLE.

                       With this, VITLE would focus on developing an alternative virtual learning program for

               college students in Methods of Research subject. Critical to achieving success in this area is

               the training of learners that includes providing appropriate instruction and continuing updates,


               considering the dynamic nature of developments in research.

                       The proposed alternative learning system is a virtual learning environment that could

               level up a modern-day method of teaching-leaning delivery that saves time and space, has

               economic value, and considers convenience of the teachers and learners.]]></page><page Index="266"><![CDATA[II. DETAILED ACCOMPLISHMENT REPORT

               Research Objective 1:


               The  objective  number  1  of  the  study  is  to  design  the  Virtual  Interaction  in  Teaching  and

               Learning Environment (V.I.T.L.E.) in Methods of Research Subject.




               Data Collected: Completed





               Findings:

                       Virtual Interaction in Teaching and Learning Environment (V.I.T.L.E.) in Methods of

               Research Subject is designed to enable a new and efficient way of interacting with students

               academically with the use of technology.

                       By using computers as the medium of learning and either local or online servers as

               database this system can improve the craft of educators by exploring a digitized approach to

               meet the expectations upon its learners. With the efficiency and convenience that the modern


               technology offers, the study can improve the method of teaching of the instructors for a more

                                 Environment (V.I.T.L.E.) in Methods of Research Subject

               Stage 1

                       The development process of V.I.T.L.E. in MoR is conducted using the agile method.


               Initially the researchers created the user interface (UI) of the website to visualize the flow and

               process of the system and to have an idea on how to approach the user experience (UX).



               Stage 2

                       Upon  the  finalization  of  the  frontend  of  V.I.T.L.E.  in  MoR  the  researchers  begin

               developing the functionality of the system together with its features. Integration and testing

               took place in this phase of the process and continues up until the researchers finalize the


               functionality development of the system and pass the integration and testing.]]></page><page Index="269"><![CDATA[Stage 3

                       The researchers commence a test run of the system to using localhost server to gather

               data regarding the performance of the system, after that the researchers gathered data from

               the test run to further improve the performance of the system inclined from the collected data


               from the test run. Test runs commence always after the researchers successfully applied the

               changes in the system up until the researchers finally reach the final phase of the process

               where all the features of the system are fully functional and the UI and UX are finalize, test

               runs are then concluded.




               Testing

                   Test runs are conducted by the researchers using a localhost server where the system is

               simulated and put through a series of testing for the researchers to see if there are bugs and

               errors in the systems functionality and interface.




               Research Objective 2:

                       The objective number 2 of the study is to develop the Virtual Interaction in Teaching

               and Learning Environment (V.I.T.L.E.) in Methods of Research Subject website as designed

               with the used of the framework Admin LTE and programming languages HTML, CSS and

                       After logging in using the administrators credentials the system will lead the user to the

               administrator panel where four tabs can be viewed, the overview tab, classes tab, instructors]]></page><page Index="271"><![CDATA[tab and the students tab. In the default tab which is the overview, the administrator can see

               the summary of the systems data, that includes the total number of students, total number of

               instructors and the existing classes registered in the system as well as the instructors assigned

               in each class and the number of students in each class. In the classes tab, the administrator


               can view all of the registered classes in the system and also the admin can update the class

               as well as delete them. In the instructors tab the administrator can view all of the registered

               instructors account, the admin can also update the instructor’s account information, change

               its password and delete the account of the instructor. In the students tab the administrator can

               view all of the registered student’s account, the admin can also update the student’s account


               information, change its password and delete the account of the student.

                       In the instructor profile, three tabs can be viewed the activity tab, students tab and the

               quizzes tab. In the activity tab the instructor can view all of the currently uploaded lessons and

               quizzes for the class. In the students tab the instructor can view the full list of the registered

               students  in  his/her  class  and  also  monitor  who’s  online  or  offline.  In  the  quizzes  tab  the

               instructor can view the quiz records of his/her students.

                       In the student profile the page only has one tab which is the activity tab, in here the


               students can view the uploaded lesson of their instructor and the students can download the

               learning material also the students can view and answer the quizzes uploaded also by their

               instructor.]]></page><page Index="272"><![CDATA[Module

               Capabilities and Limitations

                       The  capabilities  of  Virtual  Interaction  in  Teaching  and  Learning  Environment

               (V.I.T.L.E.) in Methods of Research Subject website are as follows:


                   1.  It offers a new platform where instructors can further educate their students is a much

                       efficient and interactive manner.

                   2.  Classes in this system can easily be managed by adding, updating and even deleting.

                       changing password and even deleting,

                   4.  `monitoring  the  classes,  instructors  and  student  using  this  system  provides

                       convenience with the use of the administrator panel overview.


                   5.  Interaction from the instructor to student and vice versa is made possible by the chat

                       feature of the system.

                   6.  Instructors can upload their PDF file learning materials as well as quizzes in the system

                       for the students.

                   7.  Instructors can easily manage their lessons by adding, viewing, downloading and/or

               Data Collected: Not Completed




               IV. INSIGHTS

                        We have encountered quiet a lot of challenges along the way in doing this research,

               one of such is the lack of knowledge in this particular branch of information technology which

               is web development. Not everything is taught inside the four corners of our lecture rooms or


               laboratories, we know that but learning things during this classes is not just the only thing that

               is important we know then realize that picking a certain field in your degree where you can

               utilize your skills at most is necessary when it comes to choosing a topic of your research.

                        Lacking the skill set we need to conclude this research force us to seek new and

               different  sources  of  learning  focused  in  web  development  to  gain  the  knowledge  that  our

               research requires.




                        Finalizing our research is a much harder due to the restrictions on the things that we

               can do freely due to the implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) as

               precaution to the COVID-19 pandemic. These restrictions dramatically decreased the rate of

               our progress in these recent months and press us to communicate online. Truly no one can

               delay  the  future  and  the  future  calls  for  the  new  normal  to  be  adapted.]]></page><page Index="296"><![CDATA[Overall,  our  journey  in  concluding  this  research  is  an  irregular,  challenging  and

               unexpected but at the same time necessary and fruitful.

                                                    INTRODUCTION
               Rationale
                      On May 16 2017, Dr. Hernando D. Robles, University President, designated university

               program coordinators for the different curricula offered by the university (Office Memorandum No.
               PHDR-77-17). The university program coordinators are tasked to oversee, monitor and ensure
               that the university is implementing a uniform curricular structure for each curricular program

               offered in various campuses; and that the programs are compliant with the CHED minimum
               standards. They will spearhead the conduct of periodic review and evaluation of the curricular
               programs and proposed revisions or whenever necessary.
                      The University BSIT Program Coordinator formed a committee to revise the curriculum

               structure  of  the  program,  which  is  composed  of  different  program  coordinators  from  different
               campuses and selected faculty members of the BSIT program.




                                                                                                1 | P a g e]]></page><page Index="334"><![CDATA[The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) released the latest CHED Memorandum
               Order (CMO No. 25 Series 2015) on the Revised Policies, Standards and Guidelines for the

               Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Information Systems
               (BSIS), and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), which was used as the basis
               of the curriculum revision for the BSIT program. The revised curriculum structure of the program
               will be subjected for approval of the University Academic Council, Board of Regents and CHED

               before its full implementation on the S.Y. 2018-2019.



               Objectives of the Curriculum Revision
                       The general objective of the curriculum revision was to design a new curriculum structure
               for the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) program based on the CMO No. 25
               Series of 2015.

                      Specifically, it aimed to:
                      1. compare the proposed curriculum to existing and CHED minimum standards;

                      2. prepare the breakdown of courses of the program; and
                      3. provide the checklist of the courses of the program per year and per semester.


               Strategies Performed on the Curriculum Revision

                   •  The curriculum revision committee for BSIT was formed and consisted of the Program
                      Coordinators from the main campus and each satellite campus.
                   •  The first workshop on curriculum revision was held on August 10, 2017 at CvSU-CCAT

                      Computer Laboratory.
                   •  Initial draft of the revised BSIT curriculum was presented by the program coordinators to
                      their respective campuses, department chairpersons and faculty from August 14 to 23,

                           GNED 01 - Art Appreciation. Art appreciation is a three-unit course that develops
                           students’ ability to appreciate, analyze, and critique works of arts. Through
                           interdisciplinary and multimodal approaches, this course equips students with broad
                           knowledge of the practical, historical, philosophical, and social relevance of the arts
                           in order to hone students’ ability to articulate their understanding of the arts. The
                           course also develops students’ competency in researching and curating art as well
                           as conceptualizing, mounting and evaluating art productions. The course aims to
                           develop students’ genuine appreciation for Philippine arts by providing the,
                           opportunities to explore the diversity and richness and their rootedness in Filipino
                           culture.

                           GNED 02 - Ethics. Ethics deals with principles of ethical behavior in modern society
                           at the level of the person, society and in interaction with the environment and other
                           shared resources (CMO 20 s 2013). Morality pertains to the standards of right and
                           wrong that an individual originally picks up from the community. The course
                           discusses the context and principles of ethical behavior in modern society at the level
                           of individual, society and interaction with the environment and other shared
                           resources. The course also teaches students to make moral decisions by using
                           dominant moral frameworks and by applying a seven-step moral reasoning model to
                           analyze and solve moral dilemmas. The course is organized  according to the three
                           (3) main elements of the moral experience (a) agent, including context-cultural,
                           communal, and environmental; (b) the act; and (c) reason or framework (for the act).

                           speaking, and presenting to different audiences and for various purposes (CMO 20
                           s 2013). Purposive Communication is a three-unit that develops students’
                           communicative competence and enhances their cultural and intercultural awareness
                           through multimodal tasks that provide them opportunities for communicating
                           effectively and appropriately to a multicultural audience in a local or global context.

                           GNED 03 - Mathematics in the Modern World. This course deals with nature of
                           mathematics, appreciation of its practical, intellectual, and aesthetic dimensions, and
                           application of mathematical tools in daily life The course begins with an introduction
                           to the nature of mathematics as an exploration of patterns (in nature and the
                           environment) and as an application of inductive and deductive reasoning. By
                           exploring these topics, students are encouraged to go beyond the typical
                           understanding of mathematics as merely a set of formulas but as a source of
                           aesthetics in patterns of nature, for example, and a rich language in itself (and of
                           science) governed by logic and reasoning. The course then proceeds to survey
                           ways in which mathematics provides a tool for understanding and dealing with
                           various aspects of present-day living, such as managing personal finances, making
                           social choices, appreciating geometric designs, understanding codes used in data
                           transmission and security, and dividing limited resources fairly. These aspects will
                           provide opportunities for actually doing mathematics in a broad range of exercises
                           that bring out the various dimensions of mathematics as a way of knowing, and test
                           the students' understanding and capacity. (CMO No. 20, series of 2013)

                           GNED 06 - Science, Technology, and Society. The course deals with interactions
                           between science and technology and social, cultural, political and economic contexts
                           that shape and are shaped by them (CMO No. 20 series of 2013). This
                           interdisciplinary course engages students to confront the realities brought about by
                           science and technology in society. Such realities pervade the personal, the public
                           and the global aspects of our living and are integral to human development.

                           GNED 08 - Understanding the Self. The course deals with the nature, as well as
                           the factors and forces that affect the development and maintenance of personal
                           identity. The directive to know Oneself has inspired countless and varied ways to
                           comply. Among the questions that everyone has had grapple with one or other is
                           “who am I?”. At no other period is this question asked more urgently than in
                           adolescence – traditionally believed to be a time of vulnerability and great
                           possibilities. Issues of self and identity are among the most critical for the young.
                           This course is intended to facilitate the exploration of the issues and concerns
                           regarding self and identity to arrive at a better understanding of one’s self. It strives
                           to meet the goal by stressing the integration of the personal with the academic –
                           contextualizing matters discussed in the classroom and in everyday experiences of
                           students – making for better learning, generating a new appreciation for the learning
                           process, and developing a more critical and reflective attitude while enabling them
                           to manage and improve their selves to attain a better quality of life. This course is
                           divided into three major parts: The first part seeks to understand the construct of the
                           self from various disciplinal perspectives, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and
                           psychology – as well as the more traditional division between the East and West—
                           each seeking to provide answers to the difficult but essential question of "What is
                           the self?" And raising, among others, the question: "Is there even such a construct
                           as the self?"
                           The second part explores some of the various aspects that make up the self, such
                           as the biological and material up to and including the more recent Digital Self. The
                           third and final part identifies three areas of concern for young students: learning, goal
                           setting, and managing stress. It also provides for the more practical application of
                           the concepts discussed in this course and enables them the hands-on experience of
                           developing self-help plans for self-regulated learning, goal setting, and self-care.
                           This course includes the mandatory topics on Family Planning and Population
                           Education.
