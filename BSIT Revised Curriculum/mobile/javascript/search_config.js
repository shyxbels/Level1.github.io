Robles, University President, designated university                program coordinators for the different curricula offered by the university (Office Memorandum No.                PHDR-77-17). The university program coordinators are tasked to oversee, monitor and ensure                 that  the  university  is  implementing  a  uniform  curricular  structure  for  each  curricular  program                offered  in  various  campuses;  and  that  the  programs  are  compliant  with  the  CHED  minimum                 standards. They will spearhead the conduct of periodic review and evaluation of the curricular                programs and proposed revisions or whenever necessary.                        The University BSIT Program Coordinator formed a committee to revise the curriculum                 structure  of the  program,  which  is  composed of  different program  coordinators from  different                campuses and selected faculty members of the BSIT program.                                                                                                         1 | P a g e","The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) released the latest CHED Memorandum                Order (CMO No. 25 Series 2015) on the Revised Policies, Standards and Guidelines for the                 Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Information Systems                (BSIS), and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), which was used as the basis                of the curriculum revision for the BSIT program. The revised curriculum structure of the program                 will be subjected for approval of the University Academic Council, Board of Regents and CHED                before its full implementation on the S.Y. 2018-2019.                  Objectives of the Curriculum Revision                         The general objective of the curriculum revision was to design a new curriculum structure                 for the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) program based on the CMO No. 25                Series of 2015.                         Specifically, it aimed to:                        1.  compare the proposed curriculum to existing and CHED minimum standards;                        2.  prepare the breakdown of courses of the program; and                         3.  provide the checklist of the courses of the program per year and per semester.                 Strategies Performed on the Curriculum Revision                     •   The curriculum revision committee for BSIT was formed and consisted of the Program                        Coordinators from the main campus and each satellite campus.                    •   The first workshop on curriculum revision was held on August 10, 2017 at CvSU-CCAT                         Computer Laboratory.                    •   Initial draft of the revised BSIT curriculum was presented by the program coordinators to                         their respective campuses, department chairpersons and faculty from August 14 to 23,                        2017.                    •   The second workshop was held on August 24, 2017 on the same venue. Feedbacks from                         the campuses were integrated in the proposed revised curriculum.                    •   The BSIT proposed curriculum was presented in the CEIT Academic Council meeting on                         February 8, 2018 at CvSU-Main Campus. Some recommendations were applied.                    •   A  joint-curriculum  review  of  the  BSCS  and  the  BSIT  programs  was  conducted  last                        February 27, 2018 at CvSU-CCAT Hostel in the presence of external stakeholders.                     •   The outcomes of the review were presented to the Campus Academic Council of CvSU-                        CCAT on March 14, 2018.                                                                                                        2 | P a g e","Summary of Revisions on the BSIT Curriculum                         Table 1 shows the summary of revisions done on the curriculum structure of the Bachelor                 of Science in Information Technology program.

Ethics deals with principles of ethical behavior in modern society                             at the level of the person, society and in interaction with the environment and other                             shared resources (CMO 20 s 2013). Morality pertains to the standards of right and                             wrong  that  an  individual  originally  picks  up  from  the  community.    The  course                             discusses the context and principles of ethical behavior in modern society at the level                             of  individual,  society  and  interaction  with  the  environment  and  other  shared                             resources.  The course also teaches students to make moral decisions by using                             dominant moral frameworks and by applying a seven-step moral reasoning model to                             analyze and solve moral dilemmas. The course is organized according to the three                             (3)  main  elements  of  the  moral  experience  (a)  agent,  including  context-cultural,                             communal, and environmental; (b) the act; and (c) reason or framework (for the act).

This course deals with nature of                             mathematics, appreciation of its practical, intellectual, and aesthetic dimensions, and                             application of mathematical tools in daily life The course begins with an introduction                             to  the  nature  of  mathematics  as  an  exploration  of  patterns  (in  nature  and  the                             environment)  and  as  an  application  of  inductive  and  deductive  reasoning.  By                             exploring  these  topics,  students  are  encouraged  to  go  beyond  the  typical                             understanding  of  mathematics  as  merely  a  set  of  formulas  but  as  a  source  of                             aesthetics in patterns of nature, for example, and a rich language in itself (and of                             science) governed by logic and reasoning.    The course then proceeds to survey                             ways  in  which  mathematics  provides  a  tool  for  understanding  and  dealing  with                             various aspects of present-day living, such as managing personal finances, making                             social choices, appreciating geometric designs, understanding codes used in data                             transmission and security, and dividing limited resources fairly. These aspects will                             provide opportunities for actually doing mathematics in a broad range of exercises                             that bring out the various dimensions of mathematics as a way of knowing, and test                             the students' understanding and capacity.

The course deals with interactions                             between science and technology and social, cultural, political and economic contexts                             that  shape  and  are  shaped  by  them  (CMO  No.  20  series  of  2013).    This                             interdisciplinary course engages students to confront the realities brought about by                             science and technology in society.  Such realities pervade the personal, the public                             and  the  global  aspects  of  our  living  and  are  integral  to  human  development.                             Scientific knowledge and technological development happen in the context of society                             with all its socio-political, cultural, economic and philosophical underpinnings at play.                             This course seeks to instill reflective knowledge in the students that they are able to                             live the good life and display ethical decision making in the face of scientific and                             technological  advancement.

The course deals with the nature, as well as                             the factors and forces  that affect the  development and  maintenance  of  personal                             identity.  The directive to know Oneself has inspired countless and varied ways to                             comply. Among the questions that everyone has had grapple with one or other is                             “who  am  I?”.  At  no  other  period  is  this  question  asked  more  urgently  than  in                             adolescence  –  traditionally  believed  to  be  a  time  of  vulnerability  and  great                             possibilities.  Issues of self and identity are among the most critical for the young.                             This  course  is  intended  to  facilitate  the  exploration  of  the  issues  and  concerns                             regarding self and identity to arrive at a better understanding of one’s self.  It strives                             to meet the goal by stressing the integration of the personal with the academic  –                             contextualizing matters discussed in the classroom and in everyday experiences of                             students – making for better learning, generating a new appreciation for the learning                             process, and developing a more critical and reflective attitude while enabling them                             to manage and improve their selves to attain a better quality of life. This course is                             divided into three major parts: The first part seeks to understand the construct of the                             self from various disciplinal perspectives, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and                             psychology – as well as the more traditional division between the East and West—                             each seeking to provide answers to the difficult but essential question of \"What is                             the self?\" And raising, among others, the question: \"Is there even such a construct                             as the self?\"                             The second part explores some of the various aspects that make up the self, such                             as the biological and material up to and including the more recent Digital Self. The                             third and final part identifies three areas of concern for young students: learning, goal                             setting, and managing stress. It also provides for the more practical application of                             the concepts discussed in this course and enables them the hands-on experience of                             developing self-help plans for self-regulated learning, goal setting, and self-care.
