                                                                  _

                              The Accounting Office shall post the names of students who have not
                               been cleared of accountabilities before the start of the       succeeding
                               registrationperiod.
                              The students should present their clearance before they can enroll in
                               the succeeding semester.
                         i)      Academic Load. No student shall be allowed to take more than the
                                 maximum credit units per semester. A graduating student may be
                                 allowed to enroll more than the maximum allowable credit units not to
                                 exceed 26 units during the last two semesters of his course provided
                                 that he has a GPA of 2.5 or better in the previous two semesters as
                                 certified by the University Registrar. A graduating student petitioning
                                 for registering up to maximum allowable academic load must secure a
                                 certification from the University Registrar that he is a      graduating
                                 student.

                                 During summer program, a student may be allowed a maximum

                         of three (3) lecture courses or one with laboratory and one lecture course. No
                         student will be allowed to register with two (2) laboratory courses except
                         when one is a co-prerequisite of the other.
                          j) Class Attendance. A student who has been absent from classes for at
                             least two (2) consecutive meetings must obtain an excuse slip from the
                             Office of Student Affairs and present this to the instructor concerned on the
                             day when (the student) he returns to class.
                                 Excuses are for time missed only. Work covered by the class during
                         the absence shall be made up within a reasonable time to the satisfaction of
                         the instructor.
                                 If a student has been absent in 20 percent of the time schedule
                         devoted to the class without justifiable reasons, he/she shall be dropped from
                         the rolls. If the majority of these absences are not excused and the student’s
                         performance is poor, he/she will receive a grade of “5.0”.
                         k) Changing/Adding/Dropping of Course/s. Transfer to other sections must
                                 be made for valid reasons only such as conflict in schedule.
                                 No change in matriculation will be allowed after three (3) weeks of
                         regular classes. Change in subject can be accomplished by filling          out a
                         changing/dropping form duly noted by the registration adviser            and the
                         instructor concerned and approved bythe College Dean concerned.

                             Board of Regents, shall not be construed to exclude other offenses or
                             breaches, against the rules of discipline promulgated by the President of
                             the University, directors, and teachers in those cases not provided by said
                             bodies.


                   Article 2.Class Attendance


                          a) Pupils/Students are required to attend their classes promptly and
                             regularly. If a university student is absent without excusable reason in 20
                             percent or more of the number of hours devoted to lecture, recitation,
                             laboratory or a combination of them, he shall be dropped from the roll. If
                             his performance is poor he shall be given a grade of “5.0”. A high school
                             student who is absent for 10      consecutive days shall be automatically
                             dropped from the roll on the 11 day. The said pupil/student may be
                                                                 th
                             readmitted upon presentation of a written application for readmission
                             approved by the Administrator/Principal of the Science High School upon
                             recommendation of the guidance counselor or the Dean of OSA, in the
                             case of college or graduate students.

                             and copy furnished to the Dean of Student Affairs. An excused absence,
                             however, does not exempt the student from satisfactorily complying with
                             the assignment done by the class during his absence.

                          c) In cases of leave of absence (LOA) of student, he shall be governed by

                             be worn by the pupils/students upon entry and whenever they are within

                      of expression which subsumes free speech, press, and assembly is an
                      inalienable and cherished right that is enshrined and guaranteed by the
                      Philippine Constitution and existing laws as well as national policies and
                      democratic traditions. Students of the University are free to participate in

                                 Freedom of expression is the mother of all human rights and for as
                      long as this freedom subsists; violation or vitiation of rights can be protested and
                      denounced and thus rights are protected and preserved. Freedom of expression
                      like other human rights, however, is not absolute         or unbounded; the right
                      imposes the correlative duty to exercise it responsibly with due regard for the
                      rights of others in the larger interest of harmony and welfare of society, and to
                      preclude mob rule.

                      PARENTS AND STUDENTS VIRTUAL ORIENTATION ON THE CvSU T3
                   CAMPUSES IMPLEMENTATION OF FLEXIBLE LEARNING DELIVERY MODE
                                            05 September 2020 at 1:30PM
                                                           via

               Rationale
                       On 08 March 2020, through Proclamation No. 922 s, 2020, the country was declared
               in a state of public health emergency because of the outbreak of Corona Virus  Disease
               (COVID-19).
                       Another Proclamation No. 929 on 16 March 2020 was released declaring a state of
               calamity throughout the Philippines because of COVID-19 pandemic.
                       With these and the Inter-agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging
               Infectious Diseases (IATF) Resolutions, Commission on Higher Education released CHED
               COVID Advisory No. 7, providing guidelines on the HEIs operation and work arrangements.
               The use of flexible learning delivery mode was also provided for guidance.
                       Cavite State University through the Academic Affairs Unit continuously provide
               webinars and trainings to prepare the faculty members with the flexible learning and other
               alternative modes of delivery for the AY 2020-2021. And with the series of webinars and
               trainings, the CvSU T3 Campuses come up with different strategies on how flexible learning
               will be possible.
                       Together with the faculty members, students and parents should also be informed on
               how the flexible learning will be conducted in the First Semester, AY 2020-2021 through an
               orientation.


               Objectives
                       The activity aimed to provide a clearer understanding on how the flexible learning  will
               be conducted in the T3 Campuses for the First Semester, AY 2020-2021 and at the same time
               come up with a united desire on how to provide quality education to students despite the
               pandemic.


               Program of Activities
                       The program started at 1:30PM by a prayer followed by the CvSU at a Glance video

               Question and Answer
               Question (BSP 1-Trece): Do we need books in our subjects?
               Answer (Ms. Feranil): Books are not required, but there are books which are already reviewed,
               evaluated, and approved by the University Textbook Board especially in General Education
               subjects that may be used as references.

               Question (BSP 1-Trece): Do we need to pay any fees?
               Answer (Ms. Feranil): No fees will be collected because of the RA 10931 or the Free Tertiary
               Education.


               Question (Tanza Student): Who will decide on the type of platform to use in learning, whether
               CvSU eLearning o Google classroom, is it the student?
               Answer (Ms. Villavicencio): Faculty members will define the type of platform to use.

               Question (First Year-Trece): What will happen to those students who are qualified for
               admission but did not able to submit original admission requirements?
               Answer (Ms. Anonas): Students are temporary enrolled unless original admission
               requirements are submitted.]]></page><page Index="36"><![CDATA[Question (Tanza Student): Are you going to provide each student an account to access the
               eLearning System?
               Answer (Ms. Busog): Yes, but we are still waiting for the account from Main Campus.

               Question (BSP 1-Trece): How would be the distribution of modules and submission of activities
               for those who prefer modular mode of learning?
               Answer (Ms. Feranil): There are assigned day for each program, for the pickup of learning
               materials and submission of activities in the campus as stated in the virtual class  schedule
               provided.

               Question (BSBM-Trece): What will happen if we are taking online quiz, and there were
               technical interruptions, is the system capable of saving the status of our quiz?
               Answer (Ms. Banag): Yes, it may be saved. The Instructor will just set the time for the quiz.

               Question (BSIT Parent): Will the University provide the students with a copy of University
               Academic Calendar and the tutorial on how to use the system and take the examinations?
               Answer (Mr. Villavicencio): Yes, calendar will be provided to students through Facebook page
               the same with the tutorial which was presented earlier. Since this orientation is in FB Live,
               students may review or replay the tutorial anytime since this will not be deleted anymore. And
               at the same time, during the first week of class orientation, Instructors will discuss again the
               process of using the learning platform.

               Question (BSHRM-Trece): When will we have our OJT which are scheduled last Midterm?
               Answer (Ms. Sidamon): OJTs are allowed if it is online.


               Question (GenTri Student): I am a working student; can I still attend to online classes?
               Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Yes, you may. Because we discourage synchronous classes.

               Question (Trece Student): Are the learning materials downloadable?
               Answer (Mr. Ty): Yes, all learning materials once uploaded to the platform are ready for
               download anytime as long as you have your device.

               Question (First Year Student): Are we required to attend online class in uniform? Do we need
               to buy one?
               Answer (Ms. Feranil): No, just wear appropriate outfit that is appealing to the class.

               Question (Gen. Trias Student): How sure that the answers to online exams taken by students
               are authentic, since they could search the net while taking the exam?
               Answer (Mr. Villavicencio): College set up is different from high school or senior high school.
               Examinations are skill based and not knowledge based only. Questions can be reshuffled,
               have timer and other strategies, your instructors may set it.


               Question: Which is the best mode of learning?
               Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Modular mode of learning are very risky for everyone. Since, there are
               limited transportation and at the same time there is increasing number of COVID cases in the
               area. But if you really prefer the modular type, modules will be available in a designated area
               in the campus entrance where you can get your modules. But if you want it to be delivered to
               your doorsteps, yes, it is possible, but you will shoulder the cost of shipping. But we cannot
               give you the whole semester module because that is so many pages. That is why we
               discourage the modular type of learning. Unlike online, materials will be uploaded to the LMS
               or Google classroom or could be send to you through fb messenger, chat groups, email or
               even text messages. Synchronous classes are discouraged, so meaning, if you will have the
               online, it is not necessary that you spend load for the data daily for zoom classes, no. We will
               have the asynchronous type of teaching and learning. Because our motto is NO ONE
               SHOULD BE LEFT BEHIND.
               Online is more advantageous, cheaper, or safer rather than modular.
               Another thing, we should also invest on this. Especially IT students, not only connectivity but
               also having a laptop is necessary in your program.]]></page><page Index="37"><![CDATA[Question (BSE Student): Do we have the qualifying examination schedule? If ever, will it be
               online?
               Answer (Mr. Ty): There are previous announcements that it will be scheduled in latter part.
               Answer (Prof. Sedigo): The qualifying exam is still face to face and is probably scheduled in
               January 2021.

               Question: Do we need to pay for the printing of modules?
               Answer (Mr. Ty): No payment. It is free for students because CHED paid for their tuition and
               school fees.

               Question (Gen. Trias Student): How about the academic scholars?
               Answer (Ms. Sidamon): Only Tulong Dulong and TES are active scholarship grant for this
               semester.

               Question (BSE Student): If we have 3-hour virtual class schedule, do we need to attend 3
               hours virtual class also?
               Answer (Ms. Feranil): No, we prepared the virtual class schedule for you to be aware of the
               available schedule for the teacher for consultation and possible queries or clarifications on the
               lesson. This flexible learning is a self-paced learning, so you can do the readings or studying
               in your convenient time not necessarily during the virtual class schedule. In addition,
               attendance is not part of the grading system for this semester.
               Answer (Prof. Sedigo): In addition, during virtual class schedule, that is the time that the
               teacher will post the lessons and made himself available to students’ consultations.

               Question (Parent): I am an OFW parent, can I monitor my child’s performance in the online
               learning platform?
               Answer (Ms. Busog): Yes, if the student will allow their parents to access his/her account,
               he/she will give the username and password of the student.

               Question (New Student): How can we meet our teachers? Are we going to look or contact
               them, or they are the one who will contact us?
               Answer (Ms. Feranil): Each section has assigned Registration Adviser. They are the one
               tasked to look for the students and create a group for the class. Then later, all subject teachers
               will be added to the group, so that there will be only one group for each class to elicit confusion
               on the part of the student on how to communicate and whom.

               Question (Irregular Student): How about if virtual class schedule is conflict with my back
               subjects, do I need to drop the subject?
               Answer (Ms. Anonas): No, flexible learning is self-paced and can do the learning even not
               during the virtual class schedule.

               Question: How will the lesson be delivered? Is the lesson/module will be provided for the whole
               semester one at a time?
               Answer (Prof. Sedigo): Preparing a module is not the easy but almost all faculty have their
               modules for one month or until Midterm except for some that they really have prepared the
               whole module for one semester. So module delivery, is by lesson or chapter, so that you will
               not be overwhelmed by the lessons and the activities.]]></page><page Index="38"><![CDATA[Program of Activities]]></page><page Index="39"><![CDATA[Evaluation Results

               1. Every instructor is well-prepared to answer the questions. Even though comments' section was
                   getting "flooded" by questions, they managed to answer almost all of them on time with also the
                   help of Professor Noel.

               4. Maganda naman po yung presentation about sa ibat ibang modes of learning. naipakita rin po ang
                   mga applications maaaring gamitin ng mga estudyante at naituro rin kung paano ito gamitin. naging
                   malinaw naman ang orientation para sa lahat at nasagot din ang mga katanungan ng mga parents
                   at students.
               5. Wala pong sound at some point. un lang hehe
               6. Very informative
               7. Na deliver naman nila ng ayos ang online orientation suggestion kolang mag bigay sila ng warnings
                   sa mga students na nag comment lang ng hindi maganda para bang nag papansin lang or make it
                   private para hindi masali ang mga students na gusto lang mang bastos
               8. Over-all po, okay naman po ang orientation na naganap. Maayos pong sinagot nang mga faculty
                   members ang mga katanungan namin at nalinawan po ako. Laking tulong po sa amin ang ganitong
                   orientation dahil natulungan po kaming mga estudyante at ang mga magulang na maintindihan ang
                   bagong sistema ng pag-aaral ngayong panahon ng pandemya.
               9. Ok naman po yung presentation and marami po ako facts na nalaman regarding sa online class
                   and yung delivery po nung presentation maganda
               10. It went well although there's some problem but it was fixed quickly.
               11. naway sa susunod po ee medyo maayos yung live kasi nawalawala po kasi ee
               12. Ang galing po ng graphic organiser o yung nagmamanage po ng graphics, tapos malinaw rin pong
                   naipaliwanag ng maayos yung mga topic na kailangang malaman ng mga istudyante at magulang.
                   Salamat po
               13. Napaka maintindihin ng mga teachers. Thankyou.
               14. Very creative
               15. Overall the virtual presentation was good well explained but there's some technical problems.
               16. For me it was good, and because of this virtual orientation I realized that Online learning is not so
                   hard :) . God bless!
               17. The virtual presentation and orientation itself was very satisfactory, necessary information were
                   properly explained and elaborated as well.
               18. All of the speakers are good, but there's some interruptions when it comes on presentation.
               19. I'm so grateful to have the people who were trying their best to create the education be more
                   effective. As a student, I'll pray for the faculty member of Cavsu. God Bless us.
               20. Ok naman maayos at magandang nasagot lahat ng tanong ng parents at ng student napaka
                   approachable po ng mga teachers.
               21. Not properly set the audio
               22. Thank you po na kahit medyo may technical problems eh nagawan pa din po ng paraan na
                   maipaliwanag  ng  maayos  ang  dapat  malaman  naming  mga  estudyante..  Good  job po! 
                   Godbless..❤
               23. Well appreciated yung effort ng lahat ng bumuo at speaker ng virtual orientation.
               24. Good job! I gather all of the information a to make a decision, which benefits for me in incoming
                   new normal class.
               25. Napaka ganda ng mga sinabi ni Dean   at mga plano nya sarap sa pakinggan ❤]]></page><page Index="40"><![CDATA[Working Committee

                                 The   University   may    tap   the  services   of other    accrediting
                             institutions or other outside agencies.
                   Section 6. Scheduling and Conduct of Classes.

                          a)     Course Scheduling. These guidelines pertain to tertiary  level in the
                                 University. SELSHS follows a different set  schedule.
                                        The Office of the University Registrar is tasked to  policy and oversight
                                 to course scheduling. The  College/Department is furnished a tentative schedule
                                 of  courses two months before each term, which will be used to  decide faculty
                                 assignment. The Department Head, through  the Dean/Director, coordinates with
                                 the Office of the  University Registrar on matters concerning the final
                                 scheduling of courses as well as room assignment. Faculty  schedules are
                                 prepared by the Department Head after due  consultations with the faculty
                                 members. The assignment of  loads should be based on the existing policies of the
                                 institution  governing faculty loads. A tentative schedule is usually given to
                                 faculty members at least two (2) weeks before the opening of the  semester to
                                 give them enough time to prepare. Loads are  considered final once approved by
                                 the Dean and submitted to  the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs.
                                 The  Department Head and Dean of the College sign the official  Report on Load of
                                 the faculty before it is forwarded to the Office  of the University President.

                          b)     Change of Class Schedule. The regular schedule of classes, as  approved by the
                                 Department Head and the Dean, should be  observed strictly. Faculty members
                                 should conduct their classes  for instruction or consultation purposes on
                                 schedule. Faculty  members should first inform, consult and get the approval of
                                 their department head and dean should there be changes in the  schedule. Internal
                                 arrangements between faculty members and  students are not allowed. Any
                                 deviation from the approved  schedule should be communicated to the Office of
                                 the  University Registrar.
                          c.) Class Size. A minimum number of students are required to open a  class:

                                                 Undergraduate                 — forty (40) students
                                                 Specialization/Majorship — fifteen (15) students
















                                                 Masters                      — ten (10) students
                                                 Doctoral                      — eight (8) students
                                                                                                           54]]></page><page Index="71"><![CDATA[CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS
                                                                  ________                              88
                                                                  _

                                                 Special class- below          -- ten (10) students;



                                 Should the class size fall below the minimum number, the  Department Head should
                             be informed immediately to decide  whether to dissolve the class or to maintain it as
                             a special class  approved by the Dean of the College. Should the class be dissolved,
                             faculty members should advise the student to transfer to other  classes.

                         d) First Day of Classes. During the first day of classes, faculty  members should sign
                             the registration forms of their students and  collect their class cards or
                             registration forms. The class cards serve  as evidence that the students are
                             officially enrolled in the class.
                                        A student is considered officially enrolled only after the  following
                                        steps are satisfied:
                                       University Registrar has duly certified the enrollment on  the
                                        registration cards.
                                       University Cashier has stamped on the required forms an
                                        acknowledgement of payment of fees, and

                                       Professors/instructors      have    placed   their   initials   or
                                        signatures on the registration cards.

                                    The class list, issued by the Office of the University  Registrar, provides the
                             name of the students, regular or irregular,  officially enrolled in a course. Faculty
                             members should get their  class lists from their Department Head on the first day of
                             classes.
                                        Moreover, faculty members should orient the students  about the
                             objectives, contents and requirements of the course, and  explain the bases for
                             evaluating students’ performance. It is  recommended that the students be provided
                             with a copy of the  course syllabus.
                          e) Class Meetings and Dismissal of Classes. Punctuality should be  observed at all times in
                             the conduct of classes. If the class should  start at 7 a.m., the faculty should be in the
                             classroom at exactly

                             7 a.m. Classes should be dismissed at least five (5) minutes before  the end of each
                             period to allow students to move and transfer to  their next class.
                          f) Make-Up Classes. Faculty members who miss their classes due to  official functions
                             should conduct make-up activities/classes.  Make-up activities/classes should be for
                             both extra and regular  teaching assignments. Request forms for make-up classes are
                             available at the Dean’s Office.

                                                        RULE VIII
                                                  STUDENTS’ CODE OF CONDUCT



                   Article 1.    General Provisions.


                          a) The Code shall apply to all bona fide pupils/students in the  elementary, secondary,
                             tertiary and graduate levels of the  University. A pupil/student is considered “bona
                             fide” if being  officially enrolled, he attends his classes or performs any school
                             activity inside or out of the school campus during school days or  when required to
                             perform special school related activity or  authorized to do so on non-school days.
                             He is considered “on  vacation” or “on leave” during break of school terms or during
                             holidays or vacation including Saturdays and Sundays, when his  school-student
                             relationship is temporary severed.


                          b) Every bona fide student shall obey the laws of the land, the rules  and regulations of
                             the University and standards of good society.


                          c) A bona fide pupil/student enrolled in the University assumes an  obligation to conduct
                             himself in a manner which befits a member  of the academic community and which does
                             not hamper the  university from the discharge of its educational functions. He thus
                             accepts the rules and regulations which the University prescribed  for its members
                             to enforce its effective role as an educational  institution.

                          d) The right of the University to impose sanctions against pupil’s/  student’s improper
                             conduct is derived from and inherent in its  obligations to:

                                       Preserve its standard for academic performance and  achievements


                                       Protect its property and the property of the members of  its
                                        community
                                       Secure    the   health    and   safety    of  persons     in  the
                                        University community











                                       Preserve peace, insure orderly procedures and  student   maintain
                                    morale
                                       Protect its name as an educational institution.

                             teachers in those  cases not provided by said bodies.

                          a) Pupils/Students are required to attend their classes promptly and  regularly. If a

                             them, he shall be  dropped from the roll. If his performance is poor he shall be given
                             a grade of “5.0”. A high school student who is absent for 10  consecutive days shall be
                             automatically dropped from the roll on  the 11 th  day. The said pupil/student may be

                             be applied without prejudice to the authorities taking further  action as the

                                 typhoons, earthquakes and tsunamis.

                                         With  respect to  typhoons, classes will be suspended
                                 upon advice of  the Philippine  Atmospheric Geophysical and

                                 the   approach     of   the   typhoon      becomes    more     definitely
                                 pronounced as to require suspension of  classes in the high
                                 school and collegiate levels as  well.     Aside  from  such      official
                                 announcements       to be made,        classes   may    be considered
                                 automatically suspended in the elementary grades when reports

                                        With respect to earthquakes, those of serious intensity
                                 require immediate suspension of classes to enable an inspection
                                 of the building and premises where classes are being held. A
                                 general rule to follow upon announcement of PAG-ASA is that
                                 the intensity of the tremor is at least Intensity V to allow a 24-
                                 hour period from time of the earthquake as the duration of the
                                 suspension of classes.

                                 as the occasion  arise.
                                        Classes are also suspended for short periods of time to
                                 enable students to attend University convocations or special
                                 gathering. However, these are pre-scheduled events for which
                                 announcements are circulated in  advance.

                                  e)    Forms. The documents and other requirements should
                                        conform to the forms provided by CHED in the above  cited

                                        anticipated in the implementation of  new or revised
                                        programs
                                        If the new program is designed to  replace an existing
                                 curriculum, the implementation should start from the incoming
                                 freshmen only and the old curriculum should end with the
                                 graduation of the current students taking  it.

                                 Relevant to this, the University President shall form a local
                             University-wide accrediting body to be headed by the Director for
                             Quality Assurance and Accreditation. It is the duty of this body to
                             prepare for the accreditation of  programs, including review and
                             inspection of documents (local         accreditation)     and      schedule

                                                                  _

                                 The University may tap the services of other accrediting
                             institutions or other outside  agencies.
                   Section 6. Scheduling and Conduct of Classes.

                          a)     Course Scheduling. These guidelines pertain to tertiary
                                 level in the University. SELSHS follows a different set
                                 schedule.

                                        The Office  of the  University Registrar is  tasked to  policy
                                 and oversight to course scheduling. The  College/Department is
                                 furnished a tentative schedule of  courses two months before
                                 each term, which will be used to  decide faculty assignment. The
                                 Department Head, through  the Dean/Director, coordinates with
                                 the Office of the  University Registrar on matters concerning the
                                 final  scheduling of  courses as well  as room assignment. Faculty
                                 schedules are prepared by the Department Head after due
                                 consultations with the faculty members. The assignment of  loads
                                 should be based on the existing policies of the institution
                                 governing faculty loads. A tentative schedule is usually given to
                                 faculty members at least two (2) weeks before the opening of the
                                 semester to  give them enough time to  prepare. Loads are
                                 considered final once approved by the Dean and submitted to
                                 the Office  of  the Vice President for Academic Affairs.  The
                                 Department Head and Dean of  the College sign the official
                                 Report on Load of the faculty before it is forwarded to the Office  of
                                 the University  President.
                          b)     Change of Class Schedule. The regular schedule of classes, as
                                 approved by the Department Head and the Dean, should be
                                 observed strictly. Faculty members should conduct their classes
                                 for instruction or consultation purposes on schedule. Faculty
                                 members should first inform, consult and get the approval of
                                 their department head and dean should there be changes in the
                                 schedule. Internal arrangements between faculty members and
                                 students are not allowed. Any deviation from  the approved
                                 schedule should be  communicated to the  Office of the
                                 University Registrar.
                          c.) Class Size. A minimum number of students are required to open a
                                    class:

                                                 Undergraduate                 — forty (40) students

                                                 Doctoral                      — eight (8) students


                                                                                                        87]]></page><page Index="165"><![CDATA[CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS

                                                                  _

                                                 Special class- below          -- ten (10)  students;



                                 Should the class size fall below the minimum number, the
                             Department  Head should be  informed immediately to  decide
                             whether to dissolve the class or to maintain it as a special class
                             approved by the Dean of the College. Should the class be dissolved,
                             faculty members should advise the student to transfer to other
                             classes.

                         d) First Day of  Classes. During the first day of classes, faculty
                             members should sign the registration forms of their students and
                             collect their class cards or registration forms. The class cards serve
                             as evidence that the students are officially enrolled in the class.

                                        A student is considered officially enrolled only after the
                                        following steps are satisfied:

                                       University Registrar has duly certified the enrollment on
                                        the registration cards.
                                       University Cashier has stamped on the required forms an

                                        acknowledgement of payment of fees,  and
                                       Professors/instructors      have    placed   their   initials   or
                                        signatures on the registration  cards.
                                    The class list, issued by the  Office  of the  University
                             Registrar, provides the name of the students, regular or irregular,
                             officially enrolled in a course. Faculty members should get their
                             class lists from their Department Head on the first day of classes.

                                        Moreover, faculty members should orient the students
                             about the objectives, contents and requirements of the course, and
                             explain the  bases for evaluating  students’ performance. It is
                             recommended that the students be provided with a copy of the
                             course syllabus.
                          e) Class Meetings and Dismissal of Classes. Punctuality should be
                             observed at all times in the conduct of classes. If the class should
                             start at 7 a.m., the faculty should be in the classroom at  exactly

                             7 a.m. Classes should be dismissed at least five (5) minutes before
                             the end of each period to allow students to move and transfer to
                             their next class.

                          f) Make-Up Classes. Faculty members who miss their classes due to
                             official functions should conduct make-up activities/classes.  Make-
                             up activities/classes should be for both extra and regular   teaching
                             assignments. Request forms for make-up classes are  available at
                             the Dean’s  Office.
                                                                                                        88]]></page><page Index="166"><![CDATA[CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS

                   Section 11.  Advising
                           a)    Academic Advising. The Dean of  the  College assigns an

                                 academic adviser to  each class or group of  majors.  The
                                 assigned faculty should monitor students’ academic progress
                                 and ensure that they live up to  the University/ College’s
                                 standard of excellence. Specifically, academic advisers are
                                 expected to:

                                       Keep a Cumulative Academic Folder  (CAF) for each
                                        student, Update the CAF every semester by asking the
                                        students to enter the grades obtained during the previous
                                        semester
                                       Post a schedule for consultation at the department
                                        cubicles
                                       Advise and sign the registration cards of students during
                                        enrollment
                                       Refer to OSA students who need professional guidance
                                        and counseling

                           b) Guidance and Counseling Services. While in college/campus,
                               many students experience personal difficulties that can be
                               exacerbated by the challenges of maturation, an  unfamiliar
                               environment, and academic pressure or stiff competition. Some
                               students resolve their difficulties over time on their own, a few,
                               however, are able to do so only with professional help.
                                  Guidance and counseling services  are available for all
                               students at the OSA. Such services can involve the assessment of
                               students’ difficulties in their studies, through appropriate testing
                               and assessment mechanisms, for the individual student to realize
                               his /her full potential.
                                 Faculty members are, therefore, encouraged to refer students
                               who have problems to the Office of Student Affairs (OSA). Faculty
                               members should have at hand the phone number and hours of
                               operation of the services available for the students. Above all,  they

                                    department. They must hold Master’s Degree or must have
                                    finished at least the academic requirements for a Master’s

                                    applicable. The regular number of  loads for a part-time
                                    faculty member is three (3) units. This number may be
                                    increased if the faculty member meets the following criteria:

                                          Obtains a very satisfactory teaching performance as
                                           determined from  the evaluation of  students, peers,
                                           Department Head, and whenever applicable, the  Dean.

                               member shall be twelve (12) units. Part-time faculty members
                               should be informed of their tentative teaching loads at least  two
                               (2) weeks before the start of classes. If there are changes in the
                               schedule, these shall be communicated to the faculty member

                               classes.
                                        Contracts of part-time faculty members expire at the end
                               of every term (semester or summer). The Department Head shall

                               criteria set for evaluating faculty  performance.

                                  Part-time faculty members are expected to serve the entire
                               term of their employment. Any violation of the contract will result
                               to non-renewal of  contract.

                                       Lecturer.  Appointment to the rank of Lecturer requires  a
                                        Bachelor’s Degree and at least one (1) year of teaching
                                        experience. Those with additional teaching and/or other
                                        professional experience may be accorded a higher hiring
                                        rate.

                                       Assistant Professorial Lecturer.  Appointment to  this
                                        rank requires the completion of a Master’s Degree and a

                                        experience on the  tertiary level.  Additional  teaching
                                        and/or professional experience may be  counted for
                                        determining the hiring rate. Completion of a specialized
                                        degree (LIB, MD) may be considered equivalent to  a
                                        master’s degree when applicable to the area to which the
                                        faculty member belongs.

                                        determining faculty rank.
                                       Associate Professorial Lecturer. Appointment to  this
                                        rank requires a Master’s Degree in the required field of
                                        specialization.

                   Article 3.    Policies and Guidelines on Administrative Matters
                                 a) Conduct of Official Business
                                        Travels. When faculty members deem it necessary to
                                        travel domestically or internationally for research
                                        purposes, observation or study, the President, in his
                                        discretion, may authorize the college to  allot  from  its
                                        appropriation for Traveling Expenses of Personnel, such
                                        amount as may be necessary for travel. Faculty members
                                        should inform the President in writing the details at least
                                        two weeks before  the  planned  travel to  obtain the
                                        approval and confirmation of support from the  University.

                                               Travels may be official, religious, social or personal
                                        in nature contingent on the needs of the service; hence,
                                        approval for authority to travel is needed when a faculty
                                        represents University functions, as the trip is sponsored
                                        by the University or a sponsoring inviting  agency.
                                        Field Trips. Faculty members are encouraged to  plan  field
                                        trips for ocular or on-the-spot education of students.  It is
                                        expected that these field trips be carefully correlated  with
                                        the subject matter of the course. Before finalizing
                                                                                                           23]]></page><page Index="179"><![CDATA[________    CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS 102

                                        any official field trip, however, the faculty adviser/in-
                                        charge should submit in writing its details to secure the
                                        permission of the department head and the dean at least
                                        two weeks before the planned activity. Before undertaking
                                        the trip, the department head may require that a written
                                        c o n s e n t   or w a i v e r   of p a r e n t s   b e   s u b m i t t e d   a n d
                                        accomplished by the students at least three days in
                                        advance and countersigned  by the  Dean of  Student
                                        Affairs.
                                               If a school transport facility is desired, the faculty
                                        member should accomplish and submit an application
                                        form for this purpose available at the office of the Vice
                                        President for Administrative and Support Services for
                                        approval and confirmation.

                                 b)     Dress Code. Faculty members should dress themselves  in
                                        appropriate business attire. Long or short polo/Barong
                                        T a g a l o g   i s   p r e f e r r e d   f o r   m a l e     f a c u l t y .     T h e
                                        University/College is a reputable education institution
                                        and therefore the faculty is encouraged to act as a model
                                        of appropriate dress code. Ostentatious display of jewelry
                                        and wearing of heavy or theatrical make-up and tattoos
                                        are prohibited.
                                 c)     Convocations. From time to time, the University/College
                                        invites distinguished guests and individuals to  speak
                                        before  the  student body on some topics of  current
                                        interest. If a faculty member receives a notice from the
                                        department head to attend the convocation, he or she  may
                                        opt to dismiss the class or if the attendance of the  class is
                                        required, the faculty member may bring the whole  class to
                                        t h e   p r o g r a m .   If t h e   f a c u l t y   m e m b e r   a t t e n d s   t h e
                                        convocation, then the  credit is  the  same as having
                                        conducted the  class. Notably, however, that not all
                                        classes suspended during convocations may be admitted,
                                        in view of the limited capacities of the assembly rooms.
                                        Only those classes having a more direct bearing upon the
                                        topic of the speaker may attend.  If the faculty member
                                        does not receive the notice, he/she should first consult  the
                                        Department Head whether to dismiss or bring the  class to
                                        the convocation.
                                               In addition, all faculty members are required to
                                        attend and participate in the activities such as University
                                        Foundation Day, Recognition Day and Commencement
                                        Exercises  and other important activities as may  be
                                        decided by the Administrative  Council.                            24]]></page><page Index="180"><![CDATA[________    CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS 103

                                 f)      Study without Permission. No faculty member shall
                                        enroll as a student in the University or in an outside

                                 The  University  may  tap  the  services  of  other  accrediting
                              institutions or other outside agencies.
                   Section 6.  Scheduling and Conduct of Classes.

                          a)     Course Scheduling. These guidelines pertain to tertiary
                                 level in the University. SELSHS follows a different set
                                 schedule.

                                         The  Office  of  the  University  Registrar  is  tasked  to
                                 policy      and     oversight      to     course      scheduling.       The
                                 College/Department is   furnished  a  tentative  schedule  of
                                 courses  two  months  before  each  term,  which  will  be  used  to
                                 decide  faculty  assignment.  The  Department  Head,  through
                                 the  Dean/Director,  coordinates  with  the  Office  of  the
                                 University      Registrar    on     matters     concerning      the    final
                                 scheduling  of  courses  as  well  as  room  assignment.  Faculty
                                 schedules  are  prepared  by  the  Department  Head  after  due
                                 consultations  with  the  faculty  members.  The  assignment  of
                                 loads should be based on the existing policies of the institution
                                 governing faculty loads. A tentative schedule is usually given to
                                 faculty members at least two (2) weeks before the opening of the
                                 semester  to  give  them  enough  time  to  prepare.  Loads  are
                                 considered  final  once  approved  by  the Dean  and  submitted  to
                                 the  Office  of  the  Vice  President  for  Academic  Affairs.  The
                                 Department  Head  and  Dean  of  the  College  sign  the  official
                                 Report on Load of the faculty before it is forwarded to the Office
                                 of the University President.
                          b)     Change of Class Schedule. The regular schedule of classes, as
                                 approved  by  the  Department  Head  and  the  Dean,  should  be
                                 observed strictly. Faculty members should conduct their classes
                                 for  instruction  or  consultation  purposes  on  schedule.  Faculty
                                 members  should  first  inform,  consult  and  get  the  approval  of
                                 their department head and dean should there be changes in the
                                 schedule. Internal arrangements between faculty members and
                                 students  are  not  allowed.  Any  deviation  from  the  approved
                                 schedule  should  be  communicated  to  the  Office  of  the
                                 University Registrar.
                          c.) Class Size. A minimum number of students are required to open a
                                     class:

                                 The  University  may  tap  the  services  of  other  accrediting
                              institutions or other outside agencies.
                   Section 6.  Scheduling and Conduct of Classes.

                          a)     Course Scheduling. These guidelines pertain to tertiary
                                 level in the University. SELSHS follows a different set
                                 schedule.

                                         The  Office  of  the  University  Registrar  is  tasked  to
                                 policy      and     oversight      to     course      scheduling.       The
                                 College/Department is   furnished  a  tentative  schedule  of
                                 courses  two  months  before  each  term,  which  will  be  used  to
                                 decide  faculty  assignment.  The  Department  Head,  through
                                 the  Dean/Director,  coordinates  with  the  Office  of  the
                                 University      Registrar    on     matters     concerning      the    final
                                 scheduling  of  courses  as  well  as  room  assignment.  Faculty
                                 schedules  are  prepared  by  the  Department  Head  after  due
                                 consultations  with  the  faculty  members.  The  assignment  of
                                 loads should be based on the existing policies of the institution
                                 governing faculty loads. A tentative schedule is usually given to
                                 faculty members at least two (2) weeks before the opening of the
                                 semester  to  give  them  enough  time  to  prepare.  Loads  are
                                 considered  final  once  approved  by  the Dean  and  submitted  to
                                 the  Office  of  the  Vice  President  for  Academic  Affairs.  The
                                 Department  Head  and  Dean  of  the  College  sign  the  official
                                 Report on Load of the faculty before it is forwarded to the Office
                                 of the University President.
                          b)     Change of Class Schedule. The regular schedule of classes, as
                                 approved  by  the  Department  Head  and  the  Dean,  should  be
                                 observed strictly. Faculty members should conduct their classes
                                 for  instruction  or  consultation  purposes  on  schedule.  Faculty
                                 members  should  first  inform,  consult  and  get  the  approval  of
                                 their department head and dean should there be changes in the
                                 schedule. Internal arrangements between faculty members and
                                 students  are  not  allowed.  Any  deviation  from  the  approved
                                 schedule  should  be  communicated  to  the  Office  of  the
                                 University Registrar.
                          c.) Class Size. A minimum number of students are required to open a
                                     class:

                                                         RULE VIII
                                          STUDENTS’ CODE OF CONDUCT


                   Article 1.   General Provisions.

                          a)  The  Code  shall  apply  to  all  bona  fide  pupils/students  in  the
                              elementary,  secondary,  tertiary  and  graduate  levels  of  the
                              University.  A  pupil/student  is  considered  “bona  fide”  if  being
                              officially  enrolled,  he  attends  his  classes  or  performs  any  school
                              activity inside or out of the school campus during school days or
                              when  required  to  perform  special  school  related  activity  or
                              authorized  to  do  so  on  non-school  days.    He  is  considered  “on
                              vacation”  or  “on  leave”  during  break  of  school  terms  or  during
                              holidays or vacation including Saturdays and Sundays, when his
                              school-student relationship is temporary severed.

                          b)  Every bona fide student shall obey the laws of the land, the rules
                              and regulations of the University and standards of good society.

                          c)  A  bona  fide  pupil/student  enrolled  in  the  University  assumes  an
                              obligation to conduct himself in a manner which befits a member
                              of  the  academic  community  and  which  does  not  hamper  the
                              university from the discharge of its educational functions.  He thus
                              accepts the rules and regulations which the University prescribed
                              for  its  members  to  enforce  its  effective  role  as  an  educational
                              institution.

                          d)  The  right  of  the  University  to  impose  sanctions  against  pupil’s/
                              student’s  improper  conduct  is  derived  from  and  inherent  in  its
                              obligations to:

                                 •       Preserve  its  standard  for  academic  performance  and
                                         achievements

                                 •       Protect  its  property  and  the  property  of  the  members  of
                                         its community
                                 •       Secure  the  health  and  safety  of  persons  in  the
                                         University  community

                                 •       Preserve peace, insure orderly procedures and   maintain
                                     student morale
                                 •       Protect its name as an educational institution.

                          e)  The definition or specification of certain offenses or breaches of
                                                                                                         215]]></page><page Index="303"><![CDATA[CvSU MANUAL OF OPERATIONS

                              by the Board of Regents, shall not be construed to  exclude other
                              offenses or breaches, against the rules of discipline promulgated by
                              the  President  of  the  University,  directors,  and  teachers  in  those
                              cases not provided by said bodies.

                   Article 2.Class Attendance

                          a)  Pupils/Students are required to attend their classes promptly and
                              regularly.    If  a  university  student  is  absent  without  excusable
                              reason in 20 percent or more of the number of hours devoted to
                              lecture, recitation, laboratory or a combination of them, he shall be
                              dropped from the roll.  If his performance is poor he shall be given
                              a  grade  of  “5.0”.  A  high  school  student  who  is  absent  for  10
                              consecutive days shall be automatically dropped from the roll on
                              the  11   day.    The  said  pupil/student  may  be  readmitted  upon
                                      th
                              presentation of a written application for readmission approved by
                              the  Administrator/Principal  of  the  Science  High  School  upon
                              recommendation of the guidance counselor or the Dean of OSA, in
                              the case of college or graduate students.

                          b)  In all cases of excused absences not to exceed 10 lecture hours or
                              9 laboratory hours, a student may only be readmitted to his class
                              upon  presentation  of  an  admission  slip  duly  issued  by  the
                              guidance  counselor  and  copy  furnished  to  the  Dean  of  Student
                              Affairs. An excused absence, however, does not exempt the student
                              from  satisfactorily  complying  with  the  assignment  done  by  the
                              class during his absence.

                          c)  In cases of leave of absence (LOA) of student, he shall be governed
                              by the pertinent previous provisions in this manual.

                       Article 3. Display of ID


                          a)  Identification cards shall be required of every pupil/student.  This
                              card  shall  be  worn  by  the  pupils/students  upon  entry  and
                              whenever  they  are  within  the  premises  of  the  University.    The
                              students  shall  not be  allowed  to  enter and  use  any  facilities  and
                              services without this ID card.

                              designated  “wash  day"  or  declared  field  days/special  days.
                              Laboratory/P.E. uniforms shall be worn only during the prescribed
                              time/period.

                          b)  A pupil/student may come to school in appropriate civilian attire
                              only during "wash day" or declared field/special days.  Appropriate
                              attire  means  that  it  must  not  be  scandalous,  e.g.,  any  kind  of
                              shorts,  leggings,  blouses  with  plunging  neckline  or  bare  midriff.
                              Simplicity, modesty and neatness shall be emphasized.

                          c)  Male  pupils/students  shall  maintain  a  neat  and  decent  haircut.
                              Haircut shall be maintained above the ear with no plunging hair at

                          d)  Improper dress ornaments and accessories are not allowed within
                              the University premises.


                       Article 5. Student Conduct and Discipline


                          a)  The  provision  of  this  Code  shall  apply  to  all  bona  fide

                          b)  For purposes of keeping order and promoting decorum in the class,
                              a  teacher  is  empowered  to  exclude  a  student  for  ungentlemanly
                              conduct from class and immediately thereafter to make a report of
                              such  action  to  the  Dean  through  their  respective  Chairman.    In
                              case the student is registered in another unit of the University, the
                              dean  shall  transmit  the  case  to  the  dean  of  the  other  unit  for

                                      Methods of Research Subject



               I. SHORT BACKGROUND / DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY



                       The Philippines has started to make headway in education through the policies that

               aim to expand access and improve quality. The need for human capital development has been


               the  main  motivation  behind  such  educational  reforms,  as  detailed  in  the  current

               administration’s Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017-2022. Despite notable gains, work

               remains, especially in terms of academic performance, the number of educational facilities

               and participation rates. To address these issues, the government has significantly increased

               education  expenditure  over  the  years,  initiated  structural  changes  in  basic  and  higher


               education, and intensified partnerships with the private sector and industry.

                       The  education  system  consists  of  the  three  components:  basic  education,  higher

               education  and  the  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  (TVET).  The  basic

               education directed by the Department of Education (DepEd) has undergone a major change

               in which Kindergarten is mandated in the elementary curriculum and the Enhanced Basic

               Education  Act  of  2013,  also  known  as  the  K-12  law,  made  attending  secondary  school

               mandatory  and  extended  the  curriculum  by  two  years.  On  other  hand,  higher  education]]></page><page Index="386"><![CDATA[directed by the Commission of Higher Education (CHED) which includes undergraduate and

               postgraduate programs.

                       Technology  has  made  it  possible  for  us  to  gain  access  to  diverse  and  abundant

               information.  Students  can  harness  this,  evaluate  which  ones  are  accurate  and  have


               significance, and use it to address a certain issue. Alternative Delivery Modes (ADM) was

               implemented by DepEd to address the problem on classroom congestion and other situations

               and circumstances which prevent children from going to and staying in school.

                       Virtual learning is a learning experience that is enhanced through utilizing computers

               and/or  internet  both  outside  and  inside  the  facilities  of  the  educational  organization.  The


               instructions most commonly take place in an online environment the teaching activities are

               carried out online whereby the teachers and learners are physically separated.

                       According to Tech Target (2019), a virtual learning environment (VLE) could be a set

               of teaching and learning tools designed to reinforce a student's learning expertise together

               with computers and also the web within the learning method. The principal parts of a VLE

               package embrace information mapping, student following, on-line support for each teacher

               and  student,  transmission  (e-mail,  rib  discussions,  chat,  net  publishing),  and  web  links  to


               outside information resources.

                       In addition, Koskela et al. (2005) found out, that the number of latest virtual learning

               environments (VLEs) is increasing and that are being publicized as an answer for remote and

               cross-border education. Students will perform a large vary of exercises with a computer-based

               learning setting. This can be extraordinarily necessary once the tasks cannot be experienced


               in reality, as an example because of their unsafe nature.

                       In the Philippine, the concept of e-Learning is relatively new due to lack of infrastructure

               and high cost of internet access. Public education suffers from shortages or lack of computers

               and internet access. However, the high regard for better quality education among Filipinos can

               be manifested on various government programs and policies that promote online learning into

               curriculum development.]]></page><page Index="387"><![CDATA[Methods of Research subject is one of the subjects injected in all the programs in the

               tertiary  education.  It  aims  to  develop  critical  thinking  and  problem-solving  skills  through

               qualitative and quantitative research for college students regardless of their program.

                       Research and development (R & D) is one of the necessary fields for an industry or


               company to survive. Whether a new or established company, they need to invest in R & D, so

               what more for a country?

                       Innovation is a strategy needed to have a successful R & D, which requires innovative

               people.  According  to  Patalinhug  (2003),  Philippine  innovation  system  requires  the

               collaboration of the university and relevant industry associated with the courses provided by


               the school. He further stressed, that students who are the future workers of the state will

               appreciate the importance of innovation, do a little bit of R & D activities.

                       Those points of view, were considered by the researchers, the reason for choosing

               Methods of Research subject to pilot VITLE.

                       With this, VITLE would focus on developing an alternative virtual learning program for

               college students in Methods of Research subject. Critical to achieving success in this area is

               the training of learners that includes providing appropriate instruction and continuing updates,


               considering the dynamic nature of developments in research.

                       The proposed alternative learning system is a virtual learning environment that could

               level up a modern-day method of teaching-leaning delivery that saves time and space, has

               economic value, and considers convenience of the teachers and learners.]]></page><page Index="388"><![CDATA[II. DETAILED ACCOMPLISHMENT REPORT

               Research Objective 1:


               The  objective  number  1  of  the  study  is  to  design  the  Virtual  Interaction  in  Teaching  and

               Learning Environment (V.I.T.L.E.) in Methods of Research Subject.




               Data Collected: Completed





               Findings:

                       Virtual Interaction in Teaching and Learning Environment (V.I.T.L.E.) in Methods of

               Research Subject is designed to enable a new and efficient way of interacting with students

               academically with the use of technology.

                       By using computers as the medium of learning and either local or online servers as

               database this system can improve the craft of educators by exploring a digitized approach to

               meet the expectations upon its learners. With the efficiency and convenience that the modern


               technology offers, the study can improve the method of teaching of the instructors for a more

                                 Environment (V.I.T.L.E.) in Methods of Research Subject

               Stage 1

                       The development process of V.I.T.L.E. in MoR is conducted using the agile method.


               Initially the researchers created the user interface (UI) of the website to visualize the flow and

               process of the system and to have an idea on how to approach the user experience (UX).



               Stage 2

                       Upon  the  finalization  of  the  frontend  of  V.I.T.L.E.  in  MoR  the  researchers  begin

               developing the functionality of the system together with its features. Integration and testing

               took place in this phase of the process and continues up until the researchers finalize the


               functionality development of the system and pass the integration and testing.]]></page><page Index="391"><![CDATA[Stage 3

                       The researchers commence a test run of the system to using localhost server to gather

               data regarding the performance of the system, after that the researchers gathered data from

               the test run to further improve the performance of the system inclined from the collected data


               from the test run. Test runs commence always after the researchers successfully applied the

               changes in the system up until the researchers finally reach the final phase of the process

               where all the features of the system are fully functional and the UI and UX are finalize, test

               runs are then concluded.




               Testing

                   Test runs are conducted by the researchers using a localhost server where the system is

               simulated and put through a series of testing for the researchers to see if there are bugs and

               errors in the systems functionality and interface.




               Research Objective 2:

                       The objective number 2 of the study is to develop the Virtual Interaction in Teaching

               and Learning Environment (V.I.T.L.E.) in Methods of Research Subject website as designed

               with the used of the framework Admin LTE and programming languages HTML, CSS and

               JavaScript.




               Data Collected: Completed



               Findings:

                       V.I.T.L.E. in MoR is developed using a website framework named Admin LTE with


               Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and JavaScript used to

               fully  develop  the  frontend  of  the  system  which  includes  the  UI  and  UX  and  Hypertext]]></page><page Index="392"><![CDATA[Preprocessor (PHP) and MySQL for the backend of the system where data can be added,

               visualizes the three main pages of the system after the login page which are the administrator

               panel, the instructor profile and the student profile.

                       After logging in using the administrators credentials the system will lead the user to the

               administrator panel where four tabs can be viewed, the overview tab, classes tab, instructors]]></page><page Index="393"><![CDATA[tab and the students tab. In the default tab which is the overview, the administrator can see

               the summary of the systems data, that includes the total number of students, total number of

               instructors and the existing classes registered in the system as well as the instructors assigned

               in each class and the number of students in each class. In the classes tab, the administrator


               can view all of the registered classes in the system and also the admin can update the class

               as well as delete them. In the instructors tab the administrator can view all of the registered

               instructors account, the admin can also update the instructor’s account information, change

               its password and delete the account of the instructor. In the students tab the administrator can

               view all of the registered student’s account, the admin can also update the student’s account


               information, change its password and delete the account of the student.

                       In the instructor profile, three tabs can be viewed the activity tab, students tab and the

               quizzes tab. In the activity tab the instructor can view all of the currently uploaded lessons and

               quizzes for the class. In the students tab the instructor can view the full list of the registered

               students  in  his/her  class  and  also  monitor  who’s  online  or  offline.  In  the  quizzes  tab  the

               instructor can view the quiz records of his/her students.

                       In the student profile the page only has one tab which is the activity tab, in here the


               students can view the uploaded lesson of their instructor and the students can download the

               learning material also the students can view and answer the quizzes uploaded also by their

               Capabilities and Limitations

                       The  capabilities  of  Virtual  Interaction  in  Teaching  and  Learning  Environment

               (V.I.T.L.E.) in Methods of Research Subject website are as follows:


                   1.  It offers a new platform where instructors can further educate their students is a much

                       efficient and interactive manner.

                   2.  Classes in this system can easily be managed by adding, updating and even deleting.

                   3.  Instructors and students in this system can easily be managed by adding, updating,

                       changing password and even deleting,

                   4.  `monitoring  the  classes,  instructors  and  student  using  this  system  provides

                       convenience with the use of the administrator panel overview.


                   5.  Interaction from the instructor to student and vice versa is made possible by the chat

                       feature of the system.

                   6.  Instructors can upload their PDF file learning materials as well as quizzes in the system

                       for the students.

                   7.  Instructors can easily manage their lessons by adding, viewing, downloading and/or


                       deleting it, as for quizzes the instructors can add, view and/or even delete it.

                   8.  Instructors  can  easily  register  new  students  to  her  class  in  case  a  student  is  not

                       automatically registered by the administrator.

                       view and answer the quizzes.



               However, the following are the limitations of the project:

                   1.  Instructors can only upload PDF file format learning materials for their lessons.]]></page><page Index="417"><![CDATA[2.  Only multiple choice type of quizzes can be uploaded in the system.





               Research Objective 4:

                       The  objective  number  4  of  the  study  is  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  Virtual

               Data Collected: Not Completed




               IV. INSIGHTS

                        We have encountered quiet a lot of challenges along the way in doing this research,

               one of such is the lack of knowledge in this particular branch of information technology which

               is web development. Not everything is taught inside the four corners of our lecture rooms or


               laboratories, we know that but learning things during this classes is not just the only thing that

               is important we know then realize that picking a certain field in your degree where you can

               utilize your skills at most is necessary when it comes to choosing a topic of your research.

                        Lacking the skill set we need to conclude this research force us to seek new and

               different  sources  of  learning  focused  in  web  development  to  gain  the  knowledge  that  our

               research requires.




                        Finalizing our research is a much harder due to the restrictions on the things that we

               can do freely due to the implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) as

               precaution to the COVID-19 pandemic. These restrictions dramatically decreased the rate of

               our progress in these recent months and press us to communicate online. Truly no one can

               delay  the  future  and  the  future  calls  for  the  new  normal  to  be  adapted.]]></page><page Index="418"><![CDATA[Overall,  our  journey  in  concluding  this  research  is  an  irregular,  challenging  and

               unexpected but at the same time necessary and fruitful.
